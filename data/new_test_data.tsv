1	0	"This past weekend , Americans watched in shock as "" alt - right "" members , neo - Nazis and white nationalists descended upon Charlottesville , Virginia , attempting to spread their message of hate and intolerance . "
1	0	 Clashes between white nationalists and counter - protesters were numerous . 
1	0	 One counter - protester , Heather Heyer , was killed when a man rammed his car into several counter - protesters . 
1	0	 The man , 20-year - old James Alex Fields Jr. , was later charged with second - degree murder . 
1	0	 Earlier that day , he was photographed displaying the symbols of a white nationalist group called Vanguard America , which later denied he was a member . 
1	0	 That weekend journalist Shaun King posted a video of several men beating a 20-year - old man named Deandre Harris . 
1	0	 King , who was attempting to confirm the identities of the men behind the beating , found that one of the men , Alex Michael Ramos , identifies as Latino . 
1	0	 A group called the Atlanta Antifascists then tweeted that Ramos was affiliated with the Atlanta chapter of the far - right organization Proud Boys and the far - right militia called the Georgia Security Force . 
1	0	 In a Facebook live video that has since been deleted , Ramos claimed he was n't racist because he was Puerto Rican . 
1	0	" When a viewer asked why he marched with racists , Ramos said , "" I stood by racist people but they were n't racist to me . "" "
1	0	 Ramos ' assertion that his Puerto Rican roots meant he could n't be racist is a prime example of Latinos who are completely ignorant of their ability to perpetuate white supremacy . 
1	0	 Guess what ? 
1	0	 Latinos , both here and in Latin America , do and say plenty of things that promote anti - blackness — and most of the time we do n't even blink an eye when it happens . 
1	0	 When it comes to discussing racism , we often subscribe to the black vs. white binary that we often see in the United States . 
1	0	" If our views are n't extreme , if we 're not a "" full - blown racist , "" then we 're completely absolved of perpetuating anti - blackness , right ? "
1	0	 Wrong . 
1	0	 When we think like that , we tend to ignore the colorism — often subtle — that permeates through much of Latin America . 
1	0	 It 's a difficult thing to confront , but if we do n't address it within our own community , we ca n't expect it to magically resolve itself . 
1	0	" Pulitzer prize - winning Dominican - American author Junot Diaz once said , "" White supremacy 's greatest trick is that it has convinced people that it exists always in other people , never in us . "" "
1	0	 Do n't believe him ? 
1	0	" Earlier this year , Carlos Hakas , the man who angrily knocked over an elotero 's cart in Los Angeles , exclaimed , "" I 'm not racist , I 'm from Argentina ! "" "
1	0	" In 2015 , Univision entertainment reporter Rodner Figueroa compared Michelle Obama to a cast member of "" Planet of The Apes . "" "
1	0	 When he was fired over the comments , Figueroa wrote an open letter to Michelle Obama saying he is n't racist because he comes from a bi - racial family . 
1	0	" What about last year , when Black Lives Matter was marching in the streets and you heard someone ( maybe it was you ) say , "" Latinos need to fight for our causes , like immigration reform , "" completely ignoring the fact that there are black Latinos ? "
1	0	" It does n't just happen in the U.S. The idea that anti - blackness is only a thing perpetuated by "" white Americans "" is what leads a Mexican sports newspaper to make jokes like this one , literally days after a person died in Charlottesville : "

1	9	In Washington , the ostensible story is rarely the real story . 
1	9	 We know , for example , that former President Clinton engineered a meeting with President Obama 's attorney general , Loretta Lynch , on the tarmac of the Phoenix Airport on June 27 , 2016 . 
1	9	 That 's the official story , replete with the charming and intentionally disarming detail that all they talked about was their grandchildren . 
1	9	" It was just coincidental , do n't you know , that at the time the FBI was looking into Hillary Clinton 's use of a "" personal "" email server to send , receive and store classified information . "
1	9	 And it was also simply coincidental that just a few days later , the director of the FBI - who served under Attorney General Lynch - announced that he would n't recommend a prosecution of Hillary Clinton . 
1	9	 Richard Nixon must be rolling over in his grave . 
1	9	 What we have n't known , until now , is that a frantic scramble erupted in the halls of the FBI to cover up this meeting . 
1	9	 What we have n't known , until now , is that a frantic scramble erupted in the halls of the FBI to cover up this meeting . 
1	9	 In fact , the FBI turned its sharp light not on the scandalous meeting between the attorney general and Bill Clinton - but rather on one of the whistleblowers who got the word out . 
1	9	 The organization I head , Judicial Watch , asked the FBI on July 7 , 2016 , for any records that might pertain to the infamous tarmac meeting . 
1	9	 We had to sue after we were ignored by the agency . 
1	9	 Then the FBI told us flat - out that it could n't find any records . 
1	9	 And we now know that was flat - out untrue . 
1	9	 Because , in responding to another one of our Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuits , the Justice Department gave us heavily redacted documents that showed there were additional documents tucked away at the FBI headquarters . 
1	9	 If not for Judicial Watch 's lawsuits these documents would still be hidden today . 
1	9	" Because of the revelation in our other lawsuit , the FBI - without our knowledge—""reopened "" our FOIA request . "
1	9	 The agency supposedly found about 30 pages of information , which it needed six weeks to review . 
1	9	 The FBI finally gave them to us late Thursday . 
1	9	 Now we know why the FBI played shell games . 
1	9	 The documents show that FBI officials were concerned solely about the leaking of details of the tarmac meeting . 
1	9	 None of the documents show top agency officials cared one whit about the propriety of the meeting itself , but only about who blew the whistle on the covert tête - à - tête . 
1	9	" In one email , an FBI official writes "" we need to find that guy . "" "
1	9	" And in another we learn that the Phoenix FBI office was contacted "" in an attempt to stem any further damage . "" "
1	9	 An FBI official working on Lynch 's security detail even goes so far as to suggest non - disclosure agreements to keep the full facts from coming forth . 
1	9	 No wonder the FBI did n't turn these documents over until we caught it red - handed , hiding and lying about them . 
1	9	 Simply put , the FBI appears to be fully complicit in a cover - up that attempted to influence a presidential election for a favored candidate - Hillary Clinton .

1	11	" Kelly responded to this , saying , "" You know , Mr. Speaker , I 'm not fascinated by sex , but I am fascinated by the protection of women and understanding what we 're getting in the Oval Office and I think the American voters would like to know . "" "

0	13	 Warning : Videos that appear in this article may include graphic content 
0	13	 Despite rumors , Las Vegas authorities still believe only man was responsible for killing at least 59 people and injuring 527 after he opened fire on an outdoor concert late Sunday . 
0	13	 It is now the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history . 
0	13	 Around 10 p.m. local time , a gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival from inside the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino across the street . 
0	13	 SWAT teams quickly surrounded the concert and the casino , and officers used explosives to get into the hotel room where the suspect was inside , authorities said . 
0	13	 The gunman , identified as 64-year - old Stephen Paddock , was found dead . 
0	13	 Police believe he killed himself prior to their entry . 
0	13	 Overall 23 guns , including a number of long rifles , were found in his room , Las Vegas Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill told CNN . 
0	13	 Paddock is from Mesquite , Nev. , about 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas . 
0	13	 Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo says Paddock first checked into the hotel on Sept. 28 . 
0	13	 Authorities obtained a search warrant for the home of Stephen Paddock in Mesquite , Nevada . 
0	13	 Authorities stormed the house , which is in an upscale neighborhood , on Monday afternoon . 
0	13	 They closed a two - block stretch around the house in a neighborhood that has a community clubhouse with a tennis court and a billiard room . 
0	13	 Las Vegas police say they found 19 firearms in the house . 
0	13	 Three SWAT team trucks and a bomb squad truck accompanied police . 
0	13	 Authorities are asking that anyone with possible photos or video from the incident call 1 - 800 - 225 - 5324 . 
0	13	 Police say they located 62-year - old Marilou Danley , who was initially wanted as a person of interest in this incident . 
0	13	 Danley , who was out of the country at the time , is not believed to have been involved in the shooting . 
0	13	 Paddock 's brother Eric told reporters that Danley is his brother 's girlfriend . 
0	13	 There was no immediate word on the motive for the bloodbath . 
0	13	" Lombardo said authorities believe it was a "" lone wolf "" attack . "
0	13	 Without providing evidence , the Islamic State claimed the attack , saying the shooter converted to Islam months ago .

0	15	 2 ) ] 
0	15	 I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation . 
0	15	 Five score years ago , a great American , in whose symbolic shadow we stand today , signed the Emancipation Proclamation . 
0	15	 This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice . 
0	15	 It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity . 
0	15	 But one hundred years later , the Negro still is not free . 
0	15	 One hundred years later , the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination . 
0	15	 One hundred years later , the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity . 
0	15	 One hundred years later , the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land . 
0	15	 And so we 've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition . 
0	15	 In a sense we 've come to our nation 's capital to cash a check . 
0	15	 When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence , they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir . 
0	15	" This note was a promise that all men , yes , black men as well as white men , would be guaranteed the "" unalienable Rights "" of "" Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . "" "
0	15	 It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note , insofar as her citizens of color are concerned . 
0	15	" Instead of honoring this sacred obligation , America has given the Negro people a bad check , a check which has come back marked "" insufficient funds . "" "
0	15	 But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt . 
0	15	 We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation . 
0	15	 And so , we 've come to cash this check , a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice . 
0	15	 We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now . 
0	15	 This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism . 
0	15	 Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy . 
0	15	 Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice . 
0	15	 Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood . 
0	15	 Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God 's children . 
0	15	 It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment . 
0	15	 This sweltering summer of the Negro 's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality . 
0	15	 Nineteen sixty - three is not an end , but a beginning . 
0	15	 And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual . 
0	15	 And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights . 
0	15	 The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges . 
0	15	 But there is something that I must say to my people , who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice : In the process of gaining our rightful place , we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds . 
0	15	 Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred . 
0	15	 We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline . 
0	15	 We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence . 
0	15	 Again and again , we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force . 
0	15	 The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people , for many of our white brothers , as evidenced by their presence here today , have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny . 
0	15	 And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom . 
0	15	 We can not walk alone . 
0	15	 And as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead . 
0	15	 We can not turn back . 
0	15	" There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights , "" When will you be satisfied ? "" "
0	15	 We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality . 
0	15	 We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies , heavy with the fatigue of travel , can not gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities . * * 
0	15	 We can not be satisfied as long as the negro 's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one . 
0	15	" We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self - hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating : "" For Whites Only . "" * * "
0	15	 We can not be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi can not vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote . 
0	15	" No , no , we are not satisfied , and we will not be satisfied until "" justice rolls down like waters , and righteousness like a mighty stream.""1 "
0	15	 I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations . 
0	15	 Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells . 
0	15	 And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality . 
0	15	 You have been the veterans of creative suffering . 
0	15	 Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive . 
0	15	 Go back to Mississippi , go back to Alabama , go back to South Carolina , go back to Georgia , go back to Louisiana , go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities , knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed . 
0	15	 Let us not wallow in the valley of despair , I say to you today , my friends . 
0	15	 And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow , I still have a dream . 
0	15	 It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream . 
0	15	" I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed : "" We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal . "" "
0	15	 I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia , the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood . 
0	15	 I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi , a state sweltering with the heat of injustice , sweltering with the heat of oppression , will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice . 
0	15	 I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character . 
0	15	 I have a dream today ! 
0	15	" I have a dream that one day , down in Alabama , with its vicious racists , with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of "" interposition "" and "" nullification "" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers . "
0	15	 I have a dream today ! 
0	15	" I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted , and every hill and mountain shall be made low , the rough places will be made plain , and the crooked places will be made straight ; "" and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.""2 "
0	15	 This is our hope , and this is the faith that I go back to the South with . 
0	15	 With this faith , we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope . 
0	15	 With this faith , we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood . 
0	15	 With this faith , we will be able to work together , to pray together , to struggle together , to go to jail together , to stand up for freedom together , knowing that we will be free one day . 
0	15	 And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God 's children will be able to sing with new meaning : 
0	15	 My country ' tis of thee , sweet land of liberty , of thee I sing . 
0	15	 Land where my fathers died , land of the Pilgrim 's pride , From every mountainside , let freedom ring ! 
0	15	 And if America is to be a great nation , this must become true . 
0	15	 And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire . 
0	15	 Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York . 
0	15	 Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania . 
0	15	 Let freedom ring from the snow - capped Rockies of Colorado . 
0	15	 Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California . 
0	15	 But not only that : 
0	15	 Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia . 
0	15	 Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee . 
0	15	 Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi . 
0	15	 From every mountainside , let freedom ring . 
0	15	 And when this happens , and when we allow freedom ring , when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet , from every state and every city , we will be able to speed up that day when all of God 's children , black men and white men , Jews and Gentiles , Protestants and Catholics , will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual : 
0	15	 Free at last ! 
0	15	 Free at last ! 
0	15	 Thank God Almighty , we are free at last!3

1	16	Few words could be more apposite to the tactics of the Remainers . 
1	16	 On Thursday morning , after the High Court ruled that the Government can not use the Royal Prerogative to trigger Article 50 , Gina Miller - the woman behind the case - stood outside the Royal Courts of Justice and tried to prove Abraham Lincoln wrong . 
1	16	" With a straight face she said that the case had nothing to do with the EU . "" "
1	16	" This is about process , not politics . "" "
1	16	 And she 's not alone . 
1	16	 Almost to a man and woman the Remainers have told us that all they have been trying to do is right a wrong . 
1	16	 The High Court ruled that the Government can not use the Royal Prerogative to trigger Article 50 
1	16	 That it 's a simple matter of democracy and parliamentary sovereignty being re - established and the fact they are all Remainers is irrelevant . 
1	16	 They really do think you can fool all of the people all of the time . 
1	16	 Because in the real world the case was brought by people who had only one motive : to screw up this first stage of Brexit . 
1	16	 It had almost nothing to do with process and everything to do with politics . 
1	16	 And it 's not going to stop here . 
1	16	 There is almost nothing the Remainers wo n't do to try to keep us in . 
1	16	 If that means showing contempt towards the result of the referendum - well , they wo n't bat an eyelid . 
1	16	 The entire history of the EU shows that whenever a referendum goes against them the Eurofanatics ignore it and demand another one . 
1	16	 Gina Miller said that the case had nothing to do with the EU 
1	16	 Which is of course exactly what some - such as Owen Smith , the Labour MP who was beaten out of sight by Jeremy Corbyn this summer - are now saying , arguing that any deal done by the Government should be subject to another referendum . 
1	16	 For others there 's no need even to hold a second referendum . 
1	16	 They want simply to ignore the referendum and let Parliament put the kybosh on Brexit . 
1	16	 Most wo n't admit to this because they know that it 's toxic . 
1	16	 But some , such as Labour MP David Lammy , are open about their contempt for the electorate . 
1	16	" Mr Lammy said that when Parliament decides on Article 50 : "" I will be voting in what I believe to be the interests of the country - which I think all MPs will take on board - and will absolutely not be voting to trigger Article 50 . "" "
1	16	 This is the crux of the matter because the real issue is n't whether or not Parliament should have a vote . 
1	16	 The real issue is how Parliament will vote . 
1	16	 Be clear about what many of the Remainer MPs want : to stop Brexit . 
1	16	 And remember that a clear majority of MPs backed Remain in June . 
1	16	 They speak about parliamentary sovereignty ( which , incidentally , can only be reestablished if we leave the EU ) . 
1	16	 But that 's a fig leaf . 
1	16	 What they are really concerned with is finding whatever ways they can to stop Brexit . 
1	16	 Let me tell you what is coming next . 
1	16	 When MPs have to vote on triggering Article 50 they will come up with some entirely spurious but supposedly democratic reason why they have to vote No . 
1	16	 Labour MP David Lammy said he ' will absolutely not be voting to trigger Article 50 ' 
1	16	 It 's got nothing to do with not honouring the referendum result , they 'll tell us . 
1	16	 How could you even think that ? ! 
1	16	 No , it 's because … blah blah blah . 
1	16	 On and on it will go . 
1	16	 Every time the issue is discussed they will come up with supposedly plausible reasons to do with democracy and fairness that mean they have no choice , they 'll say , but to vote No . 
1	16	 In reality they will have only one motive : stopping Brexit . 
1	16	 Their hope and plan is that the longer any decisions are delayed the more chance there is of a change of mood . 
1	16	 And they will do their damnedest to create that change of mood . 
1	16	 So in parallel they will use their powers to try to ensure we have the worst possible deal so that they can re - argue the referendum debate when the deal is done . 
1	16	 We are seeing this already with Hilary Benn , the Remainer chair of the new House of Commons select committee on Brexit , demanding that the Government reveals its negotiation stance - and so hand a huge advantage to Brussels . 
1	16	 But they are playing with fire . 
1	16	 The will of the people has been clearly expressed . 
1	16	 The referendum was unambiguous . 
1	16	 There is no wriggle room . 
1	16	 Brexit must mean Brexit . 
1	16	 If it does n't - if Remain MPs use their powers to frustrate the will of the people - then they will provoke one of the greatest constitutional crises since the Civil War . 
1	16	 Brexit committee chairman Hilary Benn 
1	16	 Thu , March 2 , 2017 
1	16	 Gina Miller is leading the challenge that has blocked Theresa May triggering Article 50 without the consent of Parliament Gina Miller has won the case to block Theresa May from Article 50 
1	16	 Parliament will be defying the people over the result of a referendum that Parliament itself called . 
1	16	 But the constitutional crisis may be the least of it . 
1	16	 It is a truism of modern politics that voters are disengaged - that their faith in the political class and political institutions is collapsing . 
1	16	 In the US that is reflected in Donald Trump 's ascendancy . 
1	16	 In France , Marine Le Pen owes her rise to a similar trend . 
1	16	 We have a proud tradition that has always pushed extremists and rabble - rousers to the edges . 
1	16	 If , however , our politicians were to show that they do not merely fail to connect with voters but are actively contemptuous of them , it is difficult to see how we could avoid disaster . 
1	16	 To say there would be anger would barely come close . 
1	16	 Not only would our political system be on the point of collapse there would be riots . 
1	16	 And it would be a political crisis entirely of the Remainers ' making . 
1	16	 These are worrying times . 
1	16	 It is not just Brexit that is imperilled by their behaviour . 
1	16	 It is our entire political system .We face political crisis ENTIRELY of the Remainers ' making , says Stephen Pollard
1	17	Despite the fact that the Las Vegas shooter would have passed any an all background checks , some on the left still think background checks will somehow solve all of our ills in this country . 
1	17	 They 're absolutely convinced that universal background checks will miraculously keep guns out of the hands of not just criminals , but also the man who may someday open fire on an unsuspecting crowd enjoying some music . 
1	17	 However , what they think will happen and what actually occurs tends to be rather dissimilar . 
1	17	 But such expanded background checks would n't have stopped any of these attacks . 
1	17	 Since 2000 , all of our mass shooters obtained their weapons without using private transfers . 
1	17	 Attacks such as the San Bernardino massacre in California and the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon occurred in states that already have universal background checks . 
1	17	 Indeed , mass public shootings have recently occurred in France , Belgium , Norway , Germany and other European countries where these background checks also exist . 
1	17	 This hole in their argument is so glaring that even some of the media have noticed it . 
1	17	" Last year , ABC News 's Jon Karl asked Sen. Chris Murphy ( D - Conn . ) , "" "
1	17	" Why are we focusing on things that have nothing to do with the massacres that we are responding to ? "" "
1	17	" Murphy responded , "" We ca n't get into the trap in which we are forced to defend our proposals simply because it did n't stop the last tragedy . "" "
1	17	 But obviously Karl 's question was n't just limited to the most recent attack . 
1	17	 Research looking at U.S. data has consistently found no evidence that any type of background checks reduce rates of violent crime . 
1	17	 Michael Bloomberg 's groups are the source of contrary claims , but they fail to analyze the national data in an academic manner . 
1	17	 They compare states with background checks next to those without them . 
1	17	 They do not compare states before and after background checks are imposed . 
1	17	 The fact is that criminals have a pipeline for inexpensive black market guns that require no background checks either , as was illustrated by CBS in their report on Chicago gun crime . 
1	17	 They 're not looking for private sellers who want the best dollar they can get from a prospective buyer . 
1	17	 They want a gun , they want it cheap , and they want it now . 
1	17	 Let 's also face the fact that criminals are , by definition , lawbreakers . 
1	17	" They 're not concerned with whatever laws you pass because they 're already breaking so many , they figure , "" What 's one more ? "" "
1	17	 Despite claims by the leftists on social media , no one supports another massacre . 
1	17	 No one at all . 
1	17	 However , it does n't make any sense to make proposals that do nothing except inconvenience and burden law - abiding gun buyers who want to follow the law . 
1	17	 While I may disagree with Sen. Feinstein 's bump - fire stock ban proposal , at least that makes some sense in light of what we know from Las Vegas . 
1	17	 Universal background checks ? 
1	17	 Nope . 
1	17	 No sense at all . 
1	17	 Of course , why should anyone be surprised ? 
1	17	 These are the same people who still think banning guns will somehow ban violence in general while doing nothing about the underlying causes . 
1	17	 Right now , things are no different except they 're also trying to ban things that have no bearing on what happened , just because they figure the public will back it at the moment . 
1	17	 And I 've had people wonder why I call these people ghouls .What Do Background Checks Do To Crime Rates ? Not What Some Think

0	19	Usually , the person with the most information makes better decisions . 
0	19	 But when you rely on info that 's wrong , chances increase that your decisions are wrong . 
0	19	 So it is with Florida 's solar power ballot Amendment 1 . 
0	19	 Opponents are funneling misinformation into the discussion . 
0	19	 The truth is that by voting for Amendment 1 , Florida voters have a historic opportunity to advance solar power in the Sunshine State , at the same time ensuring that energy consumers are treated fairly ; this includes those who choose solar and those who do not . 
0	19	 What does the amendment do ? 
0	19	 It constitutionally guarantees individuals and businesses the right to buy or lease solar equipment to produce their own energy ; this means consumers will always have the right to generate their own solar electricity , and politicians can not tamper with that right . 
0	19	 Contrary to what opponents say , solar customers can still sell any excess electricity they generate back into the electric grid . 
0	19	 More importantly , it protects Florida consumers from scams , rip - offs , overcharging and unfair subsidies . 
0	19	 It treats all electricity consumers fairly . 
0	19	 Because it is renewable energy , a tax break is provided . 
0	19	 This is because renewable solar energy aids in protecting the environment . 
0	19	 If you choose not to install solar , you wo n't be required to subsidize the costs of electric grid access and back - up power to those who do . 
0	19	" Another good point made by Florida TaxWatch is that , for Floridians who want the right to provide their own energy needs , "" this amendment raises that right to Constitutional status , which strengthens that right , as it can not be changed by state or local governments without going back to the voters . "" "
0	19	" Something else you should know , since we are seeing political leftists like the League of Women Voters dishing out misinformation to welcoming publishers like The Palm Beach Post ( which editorially calls Amendment 1 a "" fraud "" ) , is that this ballot initiative is being supported by a wide list of groups other than utility companies . "
0	19	 These include bipartisan coalitions of business , civic , non - profit and faith - based organizations working to promote solar energy without sacrificing common sense consumer protection . 
0	19	 Many of those opposing Amendment 1 are companies that do n't want you to buy your own solar panels to generate your own electricity because they want you to buy solar electricity from them . 
0	19	 Their business model is to lock consumers into 20-year contracts to put their solar equipment on your roof and sell you the electricity from it . 
0	19	 And here 's the awful catch : The current published price for one of the leading companies , Solar City , is nearly 50 % higher than what average Floridians pay for electricity today , plus its contract includes an automatic 2.9 % cost increase — double what Floridians normally face . 
0	19	" Something else these opponents fail to divulge is that they want a subsidy to operate their business model in Florida , a "" stand - by charge "" uniformly applied to every electric customer to ensure their model makes economic sense — for them . "
0	19	 I do not believe that 's good for Floridians . 
0	19	 Amendment 1 protects consumers from this type of subsidy . 
0	19	 The Amendment does not block ownership of solar , it does not make solar more expensive , and it certainly does not discourage people from installing solar on their homes . 
0	19	 These are outright lies to pull the wool over your eyes . 
0	19	 Florida deserves a holistic approach to solar . 
0	19	 Thankfully , Amendment 1 will provide a constitutional framework for solar in the Sunshine State , which will keep politicians and special interest groups from tampering with it .Amendment 1 constitutionally guarantees your Florida solar rights
1	20	The German public have , as predicted , kept ahold of nurse . 
1	20	 But it is the breakthrough of the AfD into the German Parliament that is causing headlines around the world . 
1	20	 Of course the four - year old party 's electoral success is also unsurprising . 
1	20	 In elections last September the AfD were elected to representative roles in most of the country 's regional assemblies and beat Merkel 's party into third place in her own constituency . 
1	20	 Nevertheless , yesterday 's electoral breakthrough is stunning and the success of this four - year - old party is among other things now causing a predictable rash of 1930s analogies . 
1	20	 In a media landscape where very few papers can afford any foreign coverage at all , and a social media landscape which blows around slightly sourced stories with a further splash of personal self - aggrandisement , understanding a phenomenon like the AfD is harder than it should be . 
1	20	 Many Europeans find themselves caught . 
1	20	 Firstly by the fact that the mainstream political class has done something mad in recent years . 
1	20	 As I recently explained at book - length , it is inevitable that things will get complicated when the people in charge of Europe make decisions as appalling as those Angela Merkel made in 2015 . 
1	20	 What she occasioned in unilaterally opening the continent 's doors to the world may have been humanitarian and may have had some good intentions . 
1	20	 But it was also reckless , short - sighted and will cause severe issues for German society for generations to come . 
1	20	 Most of that impact - including the daily reports of crime and sexual assault - never make it further than the German - language press , and often not even there . 
1	20	 What are the public to do when their leaders and media behave like this ? 
1	20	 One idea is that the public should n't have any choice and should be forced to keep voting for the same old parties anyway . 
1	20	 This obviously suits the incumbents , and is best achieved by depicting any and all parties concerned about immigration - including the mass immigration which people across the political spectrum now say they acknowledge to have been an unrepeatable disaster - as Nazis , fascists and racists . 
1	20	 The incumbent politicians and parties acknowledge they have made mistakes , promise not to repeat those mistakes but insist that anyone wishing to make them pay any political price must recognise that they are voting for a Fourth Reich . 
1	20	 It 's a clever , cynical ploy , employed by politicians and much of the media across Germany even more than the UK . 
1	20	 Their problem is that at some point the public recognise the ploy . 
1	20	 And in particular a moment arrives when the spell - words used by the political mainstream begin to fail . 
1	20	 Already terms like ‘ racist ' , ‘ Nazi ' , ‘ far - right ' have been worn down almost everywhere in Europe . 
1	20	 The few people who continue to claim that the public 's concerns are all racist are themselves the ones who now look ridiculous . 
1	20	 All they do is ensure that the public care less and less about the words they are called . 
1	20	 This has a follow - on problem which is especially worth pondering in Germany . 
1	20	 For if the media and political class call everybody a racist and a Nazi for years , and the public can see that these people often called racists and Nazis ( Ukip in Britain , for instance ) are - whatever else you might think of them - clearly not Nazis or racists , then you set up another problem down the road . 
1	20	 Anyone who has heard a hundred different people being called Nazis who they knew not to be Nazis is unlikely to have their anti - Nazi antennae intact when the accusation is made for the hundred and first time . 
1	20	 This is among the problems that Merkel and co have now set up . 
1	20	 The AfD 's platform and pronouncements require close and unbiased attention . 
1	20	 This should include having their words and actions reported accurately . 
1	20	 To her credit , Merkel - the great absorber of political difference - has said that she will work to bring back the people who voted AfD this weekend . 
1	20	 This suggests that she might - just might - take what is essentially the second broad option for Europe 's political mainstream . 
1	20	 That is to stop pretending that anything from a quarter to three - quarters of the general public across Europe are Nazi , fascist , racists who need to be reprogrammed , fought , denounced or ignored . 
1	20	 Instead it is to recognise that the concerns of the public are concerns that should be addressed and remedied by the political mainstream . 
1	20	 Which is n't , surely , such a radical idea . 
1	20	 We 'll see which path Germany now goes down . 
1	20	 More than Germany 's politics will depend on it .A beginner 's guide to the AfD
1	21	Commentary 
1	21	 It 's suddenly big news that there are perverts in Hollywood . 
1	21	 The really big news is that former President Barack Hussein Obama 's communist and terrorist - support network remains a state secret . 
1	21	 Attorney General Jeff Sessions wo n't touch it . 
1	21	 Until we come to grips with Obama , our first Marxist president with radical Muslim sympathies , we are adrift as a nation . 
1	21	" He ran for office as a "" committed Christian , "" a monumental deception to conceal his record of service to the communist cause , Muslim background , and grooming by suspected Soviet espionage agent Frank Marshall Davis . "
1	21	" As the world marks the 100th anniversary of the 1917 Russian revolution , America should take note of our own communist revolution - the eight years of the Obama presidency and his leadership of the global anti - Trump "" resistance . "" "
1	21	" A WND story says former Trump White House aide Sebastian Gorka believes radical Islamic jihadists , China and radical leftists pose the greatest threats to U.S. national security , but that "" they will be defeated by President Trump and his supporters who are restoring America 's global dominance and reclaiming the country 's culture . "" "
1	21	 Based on the record so far , this is as likely as Hollywood coming completely clean about Harvey Weinstein 's perversities . 
1	21	 Russia is not even on the list of Gorka 's top three threats ! 
1	21	 Yet Russia is behind the Jihadists , is in an alliance with Red China , and still backs the radical leftists . 
1	21	" Gorka tells WND , "" The immediate term threat is the Shia - jihadis - this is Iran , this is the Republican Guard , Hezbollah . "
1	21	" If they get nuclear weapons , that 's a game changer and that 's why it 's so important the president decertified the Iran deal . "" "
1	21	 Yet , Iran 's nuclear weapons program is made possible by Russia . 
1	21	 Why no mention of that ? 
1	21	 And why did n't Trump cancel the Iran deal as he promised to do ? 
1	21	 In the first place , Obama should have been impeached . 
1	21	 Under United Nations auspices , he ordered the bombing of Libya , in order to depose a ruler , Gadhafi , who had given up his weapons of mass destruction and was fighting al Qaeda . 
1	21	 The massacre of Americans in Benghazi by Jihadists resulted from this illegal and unconstitutional war . 
1	21	 All of this benefited the Muslim Brotherhood . 
1	21	 Indeed , Obama issued a secret 2011 Presidential Study Directive-11 , or PSD-11 , supporting this radical Islamist group throughout the Middle East . 
1	21	" National security reporter Bill Gertz said , "" The directive , according to officials familiar with its contents , outlined how the administration would seek to support the Muslim Brotherhood around the world despite the Islamist supremacist organization providing the ideological underpinning for jihadist terrorism for both al Qaeda and its successor , the Islamic State . "" "
1	21	 PSD-11 , which is still secret , should be released by the Trump Administration and declared exhibit number one in a criminal investigation of Barack Hussein Obama . 
1	21	 Trump was supposed to turn things around . 
1	21	" In Afghanistan , Gorka tells WND that Trump 's speech sending more American soldiers to their deaths in an endless conflict did n't use the words "" radical Islamic terrorism . "" "
1	21	 He was upset about that omission . 
1	21	 But Trump also did n't mention Russia 's role in sending arms to a Taliban faction killing our troops . 
1	21	 This is what we called the Red Jihad , a book quoting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying that Soviet / Russian support for international terrorism made radical Islam into the threat it is today . 
1	21	" He explains that , "" without the support offered by the Soviet bloc and the Arab world , international terrorism would revert to its earlier , localized manifestations before the 1960s and would hardly dominate the global scene . "" "
1	21	 If you want to defeat radical Islam , engineer regime change in Russia , which is still the global center of revolutionary violence against America . 
1	21	 Domestically , Sebastian Gorka mentions in the WND interview the influence of Obama associates Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn in academia , but ignores how their communist terrorist networks spawned the Obama candidacy and presidency . 
1	21	 These networks , nurtured even today by Bill Ayers in his new book , Demand the Impossible : A Radical Manifesto , are promising an uprising of some sort on November 4 . 
1	21	 The Refuse Fascism group , which is behind the November 4 protests , is a front of the Revolutionary Communist Party and its founder , former Ayers and Dohrn associate Bob Avakian . 
1	21	 As we document in Comrade Obama Unmasked , Obama supported America 's enemies at every opportunity , including the communist regime in Cuba , the communists running South Africa , and even the FARC narco - terrorists in Colombia . 
1	21	 But he stands out during his eight years in office as the real Russian agent , who was passive when Russia invaded Ukraine and Syria , gave Russia a nuclear weapons advantage over the U.S. , and awarded the Russians special trading privileges . 
1	21	 Working with Russia , he conceived the Iran nuclear deal . 
1	21	 However , on his way out the door , in a classic Marxist dialectical maneuver , his CIA director John Brennan launched an investigation of President Trump as a Russia agent . 
1	21	 It was a stroke of genius that put Trump on the defensive , gave the liberal news media months of joy , and resulted in multiple Russia - gate investigations , including by a former FBI director determined to get Trump . 
1	21	 On the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Mary Fatima revelations about Russia 's threat to world peace , we also learn from Dr. Paul Kengor 's new book that the Soviets were behind the May 13 , 1981 , attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II . 
1	21	 The book , A Pope and a President : John Paul II , Ronald Reagan , and the Extraordinary Untold Story of the 20th Century , says Reagan 's CIA director Bill Casey confirmed the Soviet role , in the face of official CIA resistance to the finding . 
1	21	 Until the reality of Obama 's communist support is examined and the secret role of Russia in global conflict exposed , the former president and America 's enemies will have the upper hand . 
1	21	" But Gorka and Trump seem clueless . "" "
1	21	" China has the most leverage to deal with North Korea , "" Gorka told WND . "" "
1	21	 And the fact that the president and Ambassador Haley at the U.N. have managed to convince China that even if you 're in a competition with us , you will not profit by having a nuclear war on your border and they joined us with Russia - it 's a big deal - in the tightest sanctions package against North Korea in history , that tells you how big a problem North Korea is . 
1	21	" China may be our long term enemy , but they do n't a war in their back doorstep either . "" "
1	21	 Does he really think another in an endless series of U.N. resolutions will make any difference ? 
1	21	 The U.N. is another communist front , designed by a Russian agent working in our State Department by the name of Alger Hiss . 
1	21	 Have we forgotten ? 
1	21	 Working through the U.N. is a dangerous dead end . 
1	21	" Our book The Sword of Revolution conclusively demonstrates that the "" Sino - Soviet split "" was a fraud . "
1	21	" What 's more , the "" collapse "" of Red Russia was itself a fraud , too . "
1	21	 Together , China and Russia , combined with Obama 's inaction during his two terms , have made a nuclear North Korea a reality . 
1	21	 What 's more , China is still communist . 
1	21	" An article in China Daily , entitled , "" Adapting Marxism called crucial , "" explains how Marxism is guiding the country 's future . "
1	21	 Here 's a quote : 
1	21	 President Xi Jinping , also general secretary of the Communist Party of China [ CPC ] Central Committee … said that as a party upholding Marxism , the CPC should make sure its theories keep up with the times . 
1	21	 Drifting away from or betraying Marxism will lead to the Party 's losing its soul and direction as it moves forward , Xi added . 
1	21	 Marxism is unsurpassed in achieving great heights and having a huge influence , he said . 
1	21	 The reliance on China to deal with its nuclear client , North Korea , is another dead end . 
1	21	 The key failure involves the inability or unwillingness to investigate Obama 's global network and what his anti - American policies were designed to do . 
1	21	 In terms of the threat within , consider that the FBI website still features wanted posters of two fugitives : Donna Borup and Elizabeth Anna Duke , both members of the May 19th Communist Organization . 
1	21	 Filmmaker Joel Gilbert , a speaker at our upcoming November 10 National conference on Obamunism , has cited evidence that Obama was a member or supporter of the May 19th Communist Organization , an above ground support group for the Weather Underground based in New York City from 1978 - 1985 . 
1	21	" He notes that the May 19 Communist Organization was described by Obama pal and former communist terrorist Bill Ayers as providing "" a sea for the guerillas to swim in . "" "
1	21	 Some May 19 members committed acts of violence and terrorism , such as the 1981 Nanuet Brinks robbery and murders , the bombing of South African offices in 1981 , and the U.S. Capital bombing in 1983 , notes Gilbert . 
1	21	" He adds , "" I spoke with a former FBI informant who told me the May 19th Communist Organization had a weapons training camp in the Catskill Mountains , run by former Black Panthers . "
1	21	" In addition , some May 19 members were sent to Cuba for several weeks each year with the Venceremos Brigades , a continuation of the SDS / Weather Underground program begun in the sixties , for explosives training from Cuban intelligence , DGI . "" "
1	21	" Here 's the big revelation : "" A former May 19 member I spoke with identified Obama as participating in their public protests and meetings . "
1	21	" In his ‘ Dreams ' book , Obama mentions transferring to Columbia to pursue his interest in activism and recounts attendance at some events similar to those sponsored by May 19 . "" "
1	21	 This might help explain why Borup and Duke are still on the loose . 
1	21	 And why Obama never demanded the extradition of Black Liberation Army cop - killer Assata Shakur and FALN bomb - maker William Morales from Cuba . 
1	21	 In addition to the focus on Obama , our November 10 conference will expose the Red Pope , Francis , who was Obama 's collaborator after a George Soros - engineered coup forced Pope Benedict to resign . 
1	21	" The old joke , "" Is the Pope Catholic ? , "" "
1	21	 is not funny anymore . 
1	21	 This pope is not Catholic ; he 's a communist .

1	25	Once this Harvey Weinstein debacle is completely finished , Hollywood will be a haven of racial , gender and financial equality . 
1	25	 Ha , ha — right . 
1	25	 The ongoing saga of Harvey Weinstein 's downfall continues with news about the former mogul possibly being stripped of his Oscar . 
1	25	 As police in New York and London investigate the many complaints against him of sexual assault , rumours persist that Weinstein will be booted from the Producers Guild of America . 
1	25	 Meanwhile , the name of The Weinstein Company will be changed and Weinstein 's name will be taken off future projects . 
1	25	 Even the man 's political contributions are being returned or handed over to women 's charities . 
1	25	 Other industry bigwigs and political leaders are being pilloried for not condemning Weinstein fast enough . 
1	25	 His wife has left , his adult daughter feared he was suicidal , and people are lining up to savage the guy . 
1	25	 Soon , he 'll be drawn and quartered in a public place , no doubt . 
1	25	 On the business side , it 's been reported that The Weinstein Company is a shambles , with agents and talent trying to get themselves and their projects away from the bad smell , and upcoming films such as The Current War and The Upside in release limbo . 
1	25	" The Financial Times says that Goldman Sachs is "" exploring options "" for its small stake in The Weinstein Company — and really , people , if the Goldman Sachs is taking the moral high ground , consider yourself toast . "
1	25	 So why — just out of interest — is a 30-year problem coming to light now ? 
1	25	 Did we reach a tipping point ? 
1	25	 Was Mr. Weinstein 's career in decline ? 
1	25	 Is there a power struggle nobody knows about in the offices of the company ? 
1	25	 Have we reached some sort of landmark in the ongoing saga of sexual impropriety and the war between men and women ? 
1	25	 Doubtful . 
1	25	 Still , it 's interesting that several formerly untouchable guys have been taken down recently , including Bill Cosby , Bill O'Reilly , Roger Ailes and Donald Trump , that last dude being just a bit tougher to get rid of than the others . 
1	25	 Why is the Weinstein case different ? 
1	25	 It 's not as if Harvey Weinstein varies much from all the other handsy creeps in his business — oohhh , the names we 'd insert here — and casting couch stories have plagued the industry since Florence Lawrence first fluttered her eyelashes circa 1906 . 
1	25	 Some of the more interesting fallout from the Weinstein case involves the support weasels — every Weinstein staffer who knew things were rotten is under a cloud , and so is every agent , manager , casting agent , publicist or assistant who knowingly sent some poor girl to talk to Weinstein in a hotel room . 
1	25	 And how about the lawyers who handled the hush money all those years ? 
1	25	 Be interesting to see who gets tackled next . 
1	25	 Since Weinstein is no doubt just a difference in degree , not in kind , it 's tough to say if this uproar will change anything on a permanent basis in his industry . 
1	25	 Still , it would be interesting to know why Hollywood is such a sleazy place . 
1	25	 The movie industry really is a cesspool of sexual harassment and bullying ; hard to know how so many people go to work every day in such an atmosphere of fear and loathing . 
1	25	 Many an analyst has decreed that vast amounts of money and power will do it every time , and maybe that 's true — look at Dominique Strauss - Kahn , or Silvio Berlusconi , or even l'il old home - grown Jian Ghomeshi . 
1	25	 People will risk a lot to get anywhere near rich and famous , and an industry that allows ordinary people — capable of memorizing dialogue and playing make - believe — to be treated like gods is an industry in which every sort of predatory behaviour will no doubt thrive . 
1	25	 How to explain the sexually predatory behaviour of men in every other industry is a bit more of a mystery .

0	28	We 're talking the real deal here , not that namby - pamby chemical castration . 
0	28	 An Alabama lawmaker introduced a bill Monday that would require certain sex offenders to be permanently and physically castrated prior to being released from prison . 
0	28	 The offenders that the bill targets are the worst of the worst — predators of young children . 
0	28	" Republican Rep. Steve Hurst introduced the measure requiring anyone older than 21 who is convicted of "" certain sex offenses "" against children age 12 or younger to pay for the surgical procedure before they serve the end of their prison sentence . "
0	28	 This is n't a first for Hurst — he 's introduced similar legislation seven times since 2006 , but most of his efforts never made it out of committee , according to CBS News . 
0	28	" He was prompted to begin this crusade as the result of a visit from a foster parent advocacy group that relayed a "" horrible "" story of abuse . "
0	28	" "" I 've often wondered what that child went through , physically and mentally , and what kind of shape he 's in now , "" Hurst said Monday . "" "
0	28	 They ( sex offenders ) have marked these children for life . 
0	28	 They will never get over it . 
0	28	" And if they 've marked children for life , they need to be marked for life . "" "
0	28	 CBS News reported : 
0	28	 Hurst in 2005 agreed to remove castration requirements from legislation setting tougher sentences for sex offenders . 
0	28	 Several House members at the time told The Associated Press they feared the castration language would have made the bill unconstitutional . 
0	28	 In 2011 , Hurst co - sponsored a bill that classified the sexual abuse of a child 6 years or younger as a capital offense , allowing courts to sentence offenders to life without parole . 
0	28	 Alabama residents have mixed feelings about the measure . 
0	28	" "" Somebody that wants to mess with a little girl or little boy that age should be castrated , and they should not be able to mess with any other kids , "" Keith Dison told CBS affiliate WIAT . "
0	28	" "" I understand prison and going to prison for a long time for some kind of crime like that , but to physical mutilate someone … that 's a little out there … it 's crazy , "" Jessica George told the station . "

0	34	 Tuesday morning 's Twitter post followed an article in the Daily Caller , a conservative publication that Trump closely monitors .

0	36	 This belief has been the motivation for many acts of violence towards the Black man : beatings , stabbings , lynching , as well as legislation such as the Black Codes and the 1994 Crime Bill . 
0	36	 The thought of the African - American man being an out - of - control criminal and sexual predator has marred him in society by white men , white women , and even his own community . 
0	36	 Dr. Tommy J. Curry , professor of philosophy at Texas A&M University , hopes to fight the perception of the Black boogie man with his new book , The Man - Not : Race , Class , Genre , and the Dilemma of Black Manhood . 
0	36	 The Man - Not was written to show the Black man as something other than a caricature of violence : as a full - bodied person . 
0	36	 Can people who have been studied and labeled as irredeemable and misogynist by white and Black feminist groups be viewed as men who are capable of vulnerability ? 
0	36	 Can a being that has not only historically been the target of violent racist attacks by white men and women be victims of sexual violence from said people as well ? 
0	36	" I became aware of Dr. Curry by listening to an interview he gave on the podcast , "" The Context of White Supremacy "" , a show dedicated to discussing racism with other non - white people . "
0	36	 What struck me was not how well researched Curry 's theories on white supremacy were . 
0	36	" Although his thoughts were grounded in facts , I was taken aback by how fearless he was in addressing racism , not only to the academia or "" academy "" as he likes to call it , but in everyday life . "
0	36	 Dr. Curry 's explanation of how white people can not be ignorant about racism was mind altering . 
0	36	" Instead of blaming it on no contact or lack of socialization , Curry pushes back and lays the responsibility on white culture itself , "" We know that white people have done the same type of behaviors . "
0	36	 They have discriminated against Black people ; they 've called Black people niggers and God knows what other names . 
0	36	 They always vitiated , secluded , and segregated Blackness . 
0	36	 To repeat those things does n't seem to be the work of ignorance , in fact , it seems to be the repetition of historical knowledge of about how to treat Black folk . 
0	36	" So when we see the same thing , ignorance seems to be the unrealistic apologetic . "" "
0	36	 To this day it is the most valuable theory on race that I have heard in the past five years . 
0	36	 The main part of The Man - Not is broken down into five chapters . 
0	36	" In "" On Mimesis and Men "" , Dr. Curry reveals the justification of enslaving and controlling the Black man and the origin of the "" Black Beast "" narrative . "
0	36	" In "" Lost In a Kiss ? "" , "
0	36	" Dr. Curry discusses Eldridge Cleaver 's lost manuscript The Book of Lives , Cleaver 's thoughts on the sexualization of Black men in prison , and how the mere existence of Black life provokes an attack by white racists . "" "
0	36	" The Political Economy of Niggerdom "" is a look into the negative perception of Black men held by many in the academy and other PWI 's ( Predominately White Institutions ) . "
0	36	" Dr. Curry highlights that many of the current theories being taught in colleges about African - American males are inaccurate and based on racist thought . "" "
0	36	" Eschatological Dilemmas "" talks about the often victimized Black male through sexualized violence , and why they are not afforded the ability to be seen as victims . "
0	36	" Finally , "" In the Fiat of Dreams "" illustrates how not only the death of Black men and boys is de - centered , but it is thought of as deserving . "
0	36	 Each chapter in The Man - Not presents a case of the African - American men and boys being in constant danger for existing . 
0	36	" On the state of the Black man , Dr. Curry comments , "" To be a Black male is to live in constant fear of being accused of some offense against another . "
0	36	 Black men live in a world where any accusation against them is thought to be evidence of their guilt . 
0	36	 Imagine a world in which any individual who can be thought of as a victim of a Black male has the power to define him as a criminal . 
0	36	" This is the world many Black males find themselves imprisoned within , too often defined by the accusations of others against them rather than their actual character . "" "
0	36	 This is a part of the everyday existence of being Black . 
0	36	 Your word means very little . 
0	36	 If someone accuses you of a crime , the thought is that you are guilty of said crime . 
0	36	 If you look like a criminal , chances are you are one . 
0	36	" I thought about Michael Bennett , the Seattle Seahawks football player who was held at gunpoint by police for "" looking like a suspect . "" "
0	36	 The benefit of the doubt is never given to us . 
0	36	" I was very interested in reading "" Lost In a Kiss ? "" , "
0	36	 the section of the book that highlights Cleaver 's lost manuscript , The Book of Lives . 
0	36	 I had read Cleaver 's raw Soul on Ice when I was young and had been fascinated by his view on white supremacy . 
0	36	 It was n't the bourgeois look into racism that many of his contemporaries had , but a gritty , gutter , street - level take on racist whites and the system they preside over . 
0	36	" The Book of Lives , an unpublished writing of Cleaver 's , spoke about homosexuality in prison and how , in Dr. Curry 's words , "" prisons are hedonistic warehouses . "" "
0	36	 This ties into the theme of The Man - Not : the specific societal and historic vulnerability of Black men and the white supremacist order , making the Black male disposable . 
0	36	" "" Lost in a Kiss ? "" "
0	36	 also talks about the irrational fear that whites possess towards Black people and the violence that Blackness attracts . 
0	36	" Dr. Curry quotes Frantz Fanon , author of the classic book The Wretched of The Earth on this issue : "" The Negro is phobogenic , meaning that the Negro triggers a pre - rational fear in the mind of the white . "
0	36	 This fear objectifies the Negro , over - determining his being as the phantasm of the white mind . 
0	36	" The objectified Black is endowed with evil intentions and with all the attributes of a malefic power . "" "
0	36	 After I read this , I thought of the unarmed Black men that were gunned down by police - from the adult Mike Brown , Walter Scott , down to the young Tamir Rice . 
0	36	 Black men of all ages and sizes inspire fear . 
0	36	" The most impactful chapter of The Man - Not is "" Eschatological Dilemmas : Anti - Black Male Death , Rape , and the Inability to Perceive Black Males Sexual Vulnerability "" . "
0	36	 Dr. Curry perfectly illustrates that throughout his time in America , the Negro has never been seen as a victim of sexual violence . 
0	36	" Through his raging appetite to rape women and elongated member , the Black man can not be raped . "" "
0	36	" The hyper - masculine stereotypes of Black males make it almost unfathomable for many onlookers to see Black men and boys as victims of women 's violence or rage , "" Dr. Curry says . "
0	36	 Chapter 4 also analyzes the sexualized pressure that led to many Black men being killed in the late 1800 's . 
0	36	" Because he was a Black man and could rape , the white woman was in potential danger and these men had to be lynched . "" "
0	36	 He has to be controlled . 
0	36	" He has to be locked away … "" This way of thinking has not only been used throughout the years to falsely convict Black men of raping and sexually assaulting white women , but has forever stamped the Black man as hypersexual in his own community . "
0	36	 While The Man - Not spends much of its time combating the negative stereotypes that reduce the Black man to a caricature , it also muses about life as a Black child seeing the violence that is directed at him because he is male . 
0	36	" Dr. Curry writes , "" Imagine what it means to see this life from the eyes of a Black boy , anxious and afraid of a youthful death - doubtful that he could live long enough to be a Black man ? "" "
0	36	 This is something that every Black man living in America realizes : that he could be a victim of police terrorism , state - sanctioned murder , or even killed at the hands of a white vigilante who believes his or her life is in danger . 
0	36	 I have written about this extensively , knowing that our life is perilous . 
0	36	 In the land rife with anti - Black male sentiment , The Man - Not presents the case for why Black men have not only been historically a target of every type of violent attack and stereotype , but that because of their Black maleness , this eliminates any supposed privilege they would share with white men . 
0	36	 Dr. Curry describes a world where even though Black men have the lowest employment , the lowest life expectancy , and the highest percentage of people who are incarcerated in the United States in numbers that far exceed those at the height of South African Apartheid , there is a supposed inherent advantage to being Black and male . 
0	36	 African - American men constitute the lowest numbers of being students and instructors in college . 
0	36	 They are also killed by police at a larger percentage than any other living group . 
0	36	 With all this being said , they are to have male privilege and are subjects of discourse taught in universities that African - American men are pathologically oppressive and violent . 
0	36	" This special type of vitriol is called "" Black Misandry "" a term Dr. Curry and his colleagues have popularized when discussing the anti - Black male thought . "
0	36	 The Man - Not destroys this train of thought with facts and that is what makes it such a powerful book . 
0	36	 The Man - Not is an important work that is essential in the day and age of disposable blog entries that ride on incorrect tropes about Black men . 
0	36	 This is factual work backed up by data that can be proven , and that is what is missing in conversations about race . 
0	36	 The Man - Not is a very dense book . 
0	36	 There is a lot to digest here , but a book about racism and white supremacy should not be a quick read . 
0	36	 This is a triumph in Black studies and about how the African - American man and boy is written . 
0	36	 I felt pride and satisfaction reading this book .

0	38	— As a survivor of childhood sexual trauma , there are many misconceptions I live with on a daily basis . 
0	38	 My pain is treated as fodder for jokes and people with backgrounds like mine are assumed to be abusers - in - the - making . 
0	38	 Both of these are very real issues , but today I want to talk about a third issue that many people do n't even realize about sexual abuse victims : the effect that the abuse has had in obscuring our own understanding of our sexual and gender identities . 
0	38	 It 's impossible for some of us to even understand what an innate gender or sexual identity would even feel like . 
0	38	" Our entire perception of our "" true "" gender and orientation is mutilated by our experiences . "
0	38	 It 's a well - established fact that child abuse does not cause homosexuality or gender fluidity , nor does gender fluidity or homosexuality cause people to become child abusers . 
0	38	 This is an important truth that needs to be continually disseminated as too many people still think there is a causal link in one direction or both . 
0	38	 It is unfortunate , however , that the well - intentioned desire to keep the LGBT community from being maligned has resulted in the experiences of many CSA victims being silenced because it confuses the narrative . 
0	38	 It is a testimony that is actually quite simple : for many victims of CSA , especially repeated CSA , nothing about their identity can be fully separated from the early trauma . 
0	38	 That includes sexual orientation and gender identity . 
0	38	 Which means that many CSA survivors will tell you that they can not say with a straight face that their perception of their gender identity or sexual orientation was not shunted down a different road by their experiences . 
0	38	 It is a testimony that is actually quite simple : for many victims of CSA , especially repeated CSA , nothing about their identity can be fully separated from the early trauma . 
0	38	 This requires a steady mind and a grasp of nuance to understand what is being said . 
0	38	 Obviously not all , or even the majority if , gay CSA victims attribute their orientation to their abuse . 
0	38	 Nor do , or should , gender fluid victims give credit to abusers when it comes to discovering their true self . 
0	38	 What it does mean , however , is that men who do say their identity was affected by their trauma should not be dismissed out of hand . 
0	38	 In abusive situations , coercion is often mixed with reward ( such as emotional attention ) and being forced to do something can still lead to physical arousal . 
0	38	 Such experiences can rewire the brain into seeking out similar situations as an adult for complex psychological reasons other than because of natural inclination . 
0	38	" Among male victims , the term "" SSA "" ( same - sex attraction ) continues to be a meaningful term . "
0	38	 This is a term that in other circles has become appropriately abandoned , given the connection and connotations it has with fundamentalist conversion therapies . 
0	38	 On its face , the term is benign and non - judgmental . 
0	38	 In usage , however , it is a denial of orientation as an innate and non - changing element . 
0	38	 That aspect of it , which when applied to homosexuals en masse is insulting and invalidating , is ironically exactly why some CSA survivors willingly apply it to themselves . 
0	38	 Because they are not convinced that their sexual attraction to men was not the result of early trauma . 
0	38	 In fact , they feel as if recognizing that attraction and their true orientation are at odds is actually a more authentic description of themselves . 
0	38	" I 've seen the term "" abuse reactive "" to label the difference between people who are able to know themselves apart from the abuse and people for whom the self before the trauma is a black hole difficult or even impossible to ever fully explore . "
0	38	 One of the confusing aspects to this is that throughout history and even to this day , boys who showed effeminate characteristics were and are more likely to be denied a proper support system . 
0	38	 They are more likely to be bullied and socially isolated and seen as unsatisfactory by both peers and adults . 
0	38	 This puts them at a greater risk of abuse . 
0	38	 No child is immune from the risk of being preyed upon , but many predators look for the outcast unlikely to be listened to or believed and desperate for ANY adult attention . 
0	38	 Therefore , because of society 's prejudice , LGBT youth are often at greater risk of being sexually exploited . 
0	38	 Drawn to signs of non - heteronormative behavior or not , a predator may very well strike before the boy himself understands his own orientation and gender . 
0	38	 Across his entire lifespan , a male is most in danger of being sexually assaulted between the ages of 4 and 13 . 
0	38	 Think about what you did n't know about yourself at age 7 . 
0	38	" The risk here is that conversation like this only gives fire to the bigots who want to say that there is something "" wrong "" with everyone who identifies as LGBT . "
0	38	 That would be the wrong takeaway . 
0	38	 The correct lesson is to believe individuals . 
0	38	" For those who say "" I was always this way , "" believe them . "
0	38	" For those who say "" I ca n't tell you for sure "" or "" I 'm pretty sure my SSA was caused by my abuse , "" believe them too . "
0	38	 Do n't silence their voice because some people might misinterpret it . 
0	38	 Do n't assume you know their true selves better than they do . —

1	39	Here 's one thing we can all say for certain regarding the latest twist of the Hillary Clinton email scandal : James Comey , who was once regarded as the Eliot Ness of law enforcement , a modern day straight - shooter impenetrable to political pressure , will instead leave the office of FBI chief as something closer to Inspector Clouseau . 
1	39	 Do n't take my word for it ; that 's the assessment of just about every law enforcement official , both former and present , I spoke to in the hours following his bizarre decision on Friday to reopen the case on the legality of Hillary Clinton 's email server , just days before the Nov 8 presidential election . 
1	39	 It was bizarre , these people tell me , because the whole sordid Hillary Clinton email saga should never have gotten this far ; Comey launched an investigation that developed far more evidence than anyone in law enforcement ever believed existed that Hillary Clinton broke the laws involving the receipt of sensitive government documents over an easily hacked private email server while she was President Obama 's secretary of state . 
1	39	 My sources in law enforcement were pretty convinced Comey would do the right thing and recommend charges to the Obama Justice Department , despite its political consequence , because the evidence was there and Comey was supposed to be so non political . 
1	39	 He was a Republican appointed by Democrat Barack Obama to run a quasi independent investigative arm of the DOJ because he had a fierce independent streak . 
1	39	 He famously brought white - collar cases during the pro - business Bush Administration as the US Attorney for the Southern District . 
1	39	 Later in a senior position in the Bush DOJ , he refused to approve aspects of the government 's domestic surveillance program . 
1	39	 But there appears to be limits to Comey 's independence , these same people now concede . 
1	39	" In July , Comey came up with an odd excuse for not recommending criminal charges against Clinton : He could n't develop enough evidence that Clinton intended to break the law under the standard of "" gross negligence . "" "
1	39	 It was such an odd set rationale that Comey laid out for not bringing that case that most people listening to him at first thought he was laying out his reasoning to bring charges , as he explained one reckless move after another from Clinton in establishing the private server and private emails for handing all her government business . 
1	39	 Indeed he initially laid out such a convincingly damning case against Clinton that markets began to crash for much of Comey 's tortured remarks as investors initially came to the conclusion that Hillary Clinton would be indicted and someone as crazy as Donald Trump could become president . 
1	39	 That did n't happen , of course , as Comey would explain -- and the markets that day recovered as he announced how Hillary Clinton may have done something criminal even if she never intended to do it and as a result he was giving her pass . 
1	39	 Note to reader : Markets will take criminal over crazy any day of the week . 
1	39	 But that was n't the sentiment inside the FBI , where according to my law enforcement sources , a near mutiny broke out among career agents who believe there was plenty of evidence pointing to Clinton 's gross negligence that Comey initially said never existed , and that their boss caved to political pressure from the Obama DOJ . 
1	39	 Recall , Attorney General Loretta Lynch just had a private meeting with former president and possible first husband Bill Clinton just days before Comey handed in his verdict , which added to the fetid smell of the FBI chief 's decision . 
1	39	 Then there was the evidence : Remember , Clinton has never given much of a rationale for using only a private email account via her own server to send and receive state department related emails other than its convenience , which should never outweigh national security . 
1	39	 Meanwhile , career agents argued her intent was inherent in simple creation of the private email server and exclusive use of a private email is supposed to be verboten under various laws including the Espionage Act . 
1	39	 Her supporters point out that others like Bush Administration Secretary of State Colin Powell used a private email account , but that omits the fact that Powell 's email was from a computer he kept at the state department and he used it before the document laws were beefed up post 9 - 11 . 
1	39	 He also did n't go through the process of creating his own easily hacked private server . 
1	39	 Another difference : Clinton used her private account exclusively , and Powell did n't . 
1	39	 That 's probably because Powell did n't have a reason to have a private server that he could control and erase its contents ; He did n't have a private charity that would do business with the federal government and would become a private enrichment vehicle , as Hillary and her former - president husband Bill have in the form of the Clinton Foundation . 
1	39	 Now we have Comey possibly looking to make amends with his troops , possibly looking to cover his rear end , definitely looking incompetent , because of all people Anthony Weiner , the disgraced former Congressman , and soon - to - be ex husband of Hillary Clinton confident , Huma Abedin . 
1	39	" FBI agents , investigating Weiner 's alleged depravity with an underage girl , stumbled across some more Hillary - related emails from Abedin , and as we learned Friday an investigation that was "" closed "" is now suddenly open . "
1	39	 I say closed in quotes to underscore the murkiness of FBI investigative procedures . 
1	39	 Cases are rarely officially closed and even when they are the bureau will leave the door open that additional information would re - ignite their efforts . 
1	39	 If you think this story could get any more surreal consider the following : law enforcement sources tell Fox Business that Weiner could soon cooperate with the Feds , and that ca n't be good news for his wife or her boss . 
1	39	 ( an attorney for Anthony Weiner tells Fox News there is no cooperation agreement in place ) 
1	39	 Weiner , I am told , was miffed at the Clinton 's for keeping him away from the campaign before his latest sexting episode . 
1	39	 Now facing a possible prison term for alleged dealings with an underage girl he has even more incentive to cooperate against his soon - to - be ex - wife and the Clintons . 
1	39	 I ca n't tell you whether the new emails will reach Comey 's standard for gross negligence , but that 's really besides the point . 
1	39	 The country could have been spared this spectacle if he had just done the right thing in July and recommended a charge against Clinton . 
1	39	 Then the Democrats could have regrouped and given the nomination to Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden or someone who does n't stand a chance of being indicted or impeached if elected . 
1	39	 Yes if Hillary Clinton manages to win , she will be a sitting duck for every GOP investigative committee , particularly as the odds grow the Republicans will now keep the House and possibly the Senate . 
1	39	 If you thought the last eight years were contentious , you ai n't seen nothing yet . 
1	39	 Thank you , James Comey .Why FBI 's James Comey ' Reopened ' Clinton Email Probe Days Before the Election

0	42	After only nine months in office , President Trump and family had already spent $ 147 million on personal travel , amounting to one - and - a - half times as much as President Obama and family spent in the eight years of the latter 's presidency . 
0	42	 Based on the limited information available as of October 2017 , the Trump family 's monthly travel expenditures during the early part of his administration exceeded the monthly spending averages of President Obama and family . 
0	42	 The stated total of $ 147 million for President Trump and family 's travel expenditures over nine months was vastly exaggerated and unsupported by actual data . 
0	42	 The expenses incurred by United States presidents and their families on vacation trips and other travel away from the White House are an evergreen topic of partisan debate , given that much of those , including the requisite round - the - clock Secret Service protection and use of military aircraft for travel , are footed by the federal government . ( 
0	42	" By longstanding convention , even presidential vacation travel is categorized as "" official business "" for accounting purposes , since it is assumed , the Congressional Research Service tells us , that the president is always on duty . ) "
0	42	 In that vein , an Internet meme loosed on social media nine months into Donald Trump 's presidency made the claim that taxpayer expenditures on vacations , golf , and personal security for the president , First Lady Melania Trump , and their youngest son Barron had thus far averaged more than $ 16 million per month , as compared to an average of about $ 1 million per month for travel by President Obama and immediate family during Obama 's entire eight years in office . 
0	42	 This is the text : 
0	42	 As of October 14 , 2017 
0	42	 Taxpayer dollars spend on vacations , golf and personal security while not at the White house for Barack , Michelle , Malia and Sasha 
0	42	 $ 98,000,000.00 over 8 years or $ 1,020,833.33 per month 
0	42	 Taxpayer dollars spend on vacations , golf and personal security while not at the White house for Donald , Melania and Barron 
0	42	 $ 147,000,000.00 over 9 months or $ 16,333,333.33 per month 
0	42	 Not a peep from Conservatives . 
0	42	 If accurate , the comparison is all the more striking in that Trump was an inveterate critic of President Obama 's travel and vacation expenses for years : 
0	42	 The Obama 's Spain vacation cost taxpayers over $ 476 K http://t.co/W6kIpd5x They love to spend money . 
0	42	" "" I would rarely leave the White House because there 's so much work to be done , "" Trump told The Hill in 2015 . "" "
0	42	 I would not be a president who took vacations . 
0	42	" I would not be a president that takes time off . "" "
0	42	" While campaigning for the presidency in 2016 , Trump said to the American people : "" I 'm going to be working for you . "
0	42	" I 'm not going to have time to go play golf . "" "
0	42	 In point of fact , according to a report in USA Today , Trump only spent five of his first 26 weekends as president holed up exclusively in the White House . 
0	42	 The rest entailed trips to his nearby golf clubs . 
0	42	 In early August 2017 , CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller toted up how many days Trump had spent away from the White House versus the number of days Obama spent offsite and found that Trump 's total , at all or part of 41 days away from Washington , was nearly twice Obama 's , at all or part of 21 days away ( although George W. Bush had them both beat at 61 days away ) . 
0	42	 Although it 's too soon as of October 2017 , just nine months into his presidency , to render even a semi - complete portrait of the Trump family 's travel expenses ( such details are rarely released except in response to Freedom of Information Act inquiries , and sometimes not even then ) , preliminary indications are that Trump 's past criticisms of Obama will come back to haunt him . 
0	42	 Looking at the information we do have , the Obama family 's travel expenses during the entire eight years of his presidency totaled approximately $ 106 million , according to the most recent FOIA numbers released by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch , who kept close tabs on Obama 's spending . 
0	42	 The Obamas ' travel expenses therefore averaged about $ 1.1 million per month over the course of his term . 
0	42	 Turning to Trump , the alleged $ 147 million already spent on travel by the president and his family during his first nine months in office wildly exceeds anything supported by actual data . 
0	42	 That having been said , it does appear , based on the information available , that Trump and family have indeed likely outstripped the Obamas in terms of monthly travel costs , albeit by a smaller margin than claimed . 
0	42	 Judicial Watch , who have vowed to monitor Trump 's travel expenses as closely as they did Obama 's ( FOIA requests are already on file ) , reported in July 2017 that two months into Trump 's presidency taxpayers were already on the hook for $ 3.58 million in charges for air travel alone ( i.e. , excluding auxiliary costs such as Secret Service housing , local transporation , police protection , etc . ) 
0	42	 by the president , first lady , and vice president during February and March . 
0	42	 That 's roughly $ 1.8 million per month , $ 700,000 more than the Obamas ' monthly average , which included the auxiliary costs we do n't yet have for Trump . 
0	42	 Focusing just on Trump 's Mar - a - Lago trips , of which there were seven between Inauguration Day and mid - August 2017 , an attempt at a more comprehensive estimate by the progressive watchdog group Center for American Progress Action Fund settled on a cost of roughly $ 3 million per trip — a total of $ 21 million for all of Trump 's Mar - a - Lago stays through August , amounting to $ 2.6 million per month ) . 
0	42	 The reliability of that estimate has been rightly called into question , given that it was generalized from a Government Accountability Office report written well before Trump took office , but it is indicative of how high the Trump family 's travel costs — when they are updated to include actual Secret Service expenses and incidentals might well go . 
0	42	 For that matter , obligatory Secret Service protection extends to all of Trump 's children , including his two adult sons , whose security costs while traveling are borne by American taxpayers even though they do n't work for the administration , instead running their father 's international business holdings . 
0	42	 According to CBS News , lodging and transportation costs for federal agents protecting Eric and Donald Trump Jr. on their travels had already surpassed $ 190,000 by the end of President Trump 's third month in office . 
0	42	 Also indicative is a USA Today report that in addition to his Mar - a - Lago residencies , as of 21 August Trump had racked up five visits to his private golf club in New Jersey . 
0	42	 At these two locations , the Secret Service spent $ 60,000 on rent for the golf carts needed to protect the president . 
0	42	 If that pattern continues , American taxpayers can expect to be dinged for as much as $ 103,000 per year in golf cart rentals alone . 
0	42	 Although there is n't yet enough information to work up a detailed comparison of the Trump family 's travel expenses versus the Obama family 's , it seems a near certainty , barring a dramatic change in lifestyle , that the Trumps ' expenses will continue to outpace the Obamas ' by a healthy margin , although nowhere approaching the $ 15 million - a - month disparity alleged by Internet sources .

1	47	The 2016 Election Will Never End Getty Images 
1	47	 November 8th may just be the start . 
1	47	 By now , you know that walking Illinois - Nazi - rally Donald Trump is finished . 
1	47	 His polls are shit . 
1	47	 His reputation is somehow worse than it was when he started running for office . 
1	47	 His spokespeople are imbeciles . 
1	47	 His ground game is nonexistent . 
1	47	 He has a record of scandal and disgrace that will NEVER be matched by anyone ever again . ( 
1	47	 I feel like I 'm watching Cy Young pitch when he opens his mouth . ) 
1	47	 He 's gon na get trounced . 
1	47	 And I wish the prospect of a Trump defeat offered us all some measure of relief . 
1	47	 I wish I could point at November 8th on the calendar and tell you , definitively , that this living nightmare will finally be fucking over . 
1	47	 But I ca n't . 
1	47	 I know that is n't true at all . 
1	47	 I know that November 8th is only the beginning of our miseries , because one of the most depressing things about this election season — which has already put America on the brink of suicide — is the fact that it is n't gon na end on Election Day . 
1	47	 We know Trump will lose , and we also now know that Trump and his acolytes have NO plans to lose graciously . 
1	47	 Trump is n't gon na concede , and he is n't gon na go away , not when he 's already achieved the wet dream of seeing his every word move mountains . 
1	47	 He will do his best to undermine the election results , and stoke violence , and gin up perpetual outrage against the media , and he will appear on your television screen every hour on the hour — summoned like a fucking genie — to rail against the legitimacy of a Hillary Clinton presidency . 
1	47	 And he 'll have the unofficial support of his estranged party when he does . 
1	47	 As much as the GOP establishment wants to treat Trump like a fart in an elevator , come November 8th they will share the exact same goal , and utilize the same truther news outlets to achieve it . 
1	47	 It 's been discouraging to watch the GOP stymie Obama at every turn for the last eight years ( with Obama , at times , being far too deferential to them ) , and it 's not like they 're gon na magically grow a heart once Hillary Clinton takes office . 
1	47	 I promise you that dipshits like Mitch McConnell will declare it their mission to thwart Clinton , and then sit on their dicks for the duration of her stay in the White House . 
1	47	 That 's how the GOP works . 
1	47	 They deserve to go down with Trump and yet , somehow , they 'll survive all this , without being forced to learn a thing . 
1	47	 Even if they lose control of Congress , they 'll find a way to regenerate and then fuck everyone . 
1	47	 Everything Trump does in practice , they do in policy . 
1	47	" And they 'll have the support of both their donors AND the pig voters they have nurtured for years ( who have been granted more anthropological empathy than virtually any other segment of society ) , the ones who flocked to Trump this year but will gladly stick by the Republican party because they 've been conditioned for the past three decades to cry out "" BITCH ! "" "
1	47	 any time anyone says the name Hillary out loud . 
1	47	 These people are in each other 's thrall forevermore . 
1	47	 Wait ! 
1	47	 It gets worse ! 
1	47	 Not only will Republicans re - litigate this election into eternity , but they will have the firm backing of cable news when they do it . 
1	47	 This election is an industry now , and cable news has figured out how to frack it for maximum resources . 
1	47	 CNN has finally hit upon a thriving business model by having insane people lose their shit on panel shows . 
1	47	" Shitbag insiders like Mark Halperin have mastered horse - trading access to Trump for "" fairness "" . "
1	47	" MSNBC has paraded out a conga line of bozos like Chuck Todd ( wistfully referring to Trump spokespuppet Kellyanne Conway : "" She 's just a very good person "" ) and Chris Matthews and Joe Scarborough who are jussssst cynically balanced enough for the network to say , "" We 're liberal but we 're not TOO liberal , you guys ! "" "
1	47	 Like the GOP itself , these networks are TERRIFIED of alienating Trump 's base of racist hicks and their QVC housewives , so they bend over backward to accommodate them even as these loons scrawl swastikas on the press table .

1	47	 This is how a boob like Paul Ryan — he 's so emotionally torn here , you guys!—somehow engenders more sympathy from certain people than Trump 's victims do . 
1	47	 No one ever gets written off for good the way they ought to be . 
1	47	 During the second debate , Trump lied nearly every minute , threatened to jail his opponent , defended talking about grabbing women by the pussy by saying it was locker room talk , humped his chair , invited Bill Clinton 's accusers to the debate and planned to have them angrily confront him on camera , frequently pointed at Hillary Clinton like he wanted to stab her with his Tiny Tim finger , admitted once more to not paying his taxes , and generally made the whole world uncomfortable . 
1	47	" And yet there was Matthews afterward , crowing , "" This one had a far less clear outcome ! "" "
1	47	 He really said that . 
1	47	 Christ . 
1	47	 I have n't even gotten to the alt - right sites yet … sites that would likely benefit more from Trump losing than from him winning . 
1	47	 Alex Jones will get to rip his shirt off nightly , to the delight of both the uneducated and Irony Twitter . 
1	47	 Brietbart will continue to be its own political fiefdom . 
1	47	 Fox News will eagerly patch up the schism between Trumpites and normal conservatives in order to sell you more fallout tents and safe deposit boxes . 
1	47	 As President Obama said yesterday , these sites are the byproducts of years and years of GOP handiwork . 
1	47	 Debunking them is a full - time job . 
1	47	 They wo n't vanish in a single night . 
1	47	 Pepe the Frog is n't going away . 
1	47	" The second Trump loses , he 's gon na appear on your Facebook Uncle 's shoulder and whisper "" BURN IT ALL . "" "
1	47	 We will never be free of this election , not when there 's profit to be had from it , both financially and ideologically . 
1	47	 The madness of 2016 will bleed into 2020 , and then into 2024 , and on and on with no rest . 
1	47	 I hate admitting this . 
1	47	 I genuinely believe that people are good , for the most part . 
1	47	 But I 've seen too much now . 
1	47	 In a sane universe , the number of Trump supporters is zero . 
1	47	 The fact that he has any support at all — much less from millions of people — suggests a brokenness in America that will take a long , long time to fix , if it ever gets fixed at all .

1	49	If You Vote For Trump , Then Screw You 
1	49	 Drew Magary wants a word with anyone who 's about to be on the wrong side of history . 
1	49	 Earlier this week , the Washington Post 's David Fahrenthold uncovered yet another Donald Trump scam job , in which he used over $ 250,000 in charitable donations to help pay off his legal bills . 
1	49	 And , because this is Trump , that sordid ( and almost certainly illegal ) bit of money laundering is just ONE despicable detail of the story . 
1	49	" There are many more , including Trump 's club trying to welch on a $ 1 million hole - in - one payout ( out of all of Trump 's bad qualities , his steadfast refusal to pay people what he owes them , while bragging about it , is the most enraging ) , along with the old bit about Trump blithely ignoring local ordinances so he could put a big , dipshit flagpole up at the Mar - A - Lago club , with his lawyers stating — with a straight face — that a smaller flag "" would fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J. Trump 's . . . "
1	49	" patriotism "" ( NOTE : Until recently , Trump did n't know what the stripes on the flag symbolized ) . "
1	49	 None of this is surprising , of course . 
1	49	 Trump is a liar and a crook , and he commits abominable acts at such a frenetic pace that they get lost in the fury surrounding whatever horrible thing he does next . 
1	49	 Keith Olbermann needed over 17 minutes on this site just to list a fraction of the atrocities Trump has staged during election season , and he 's gon na need 17 more minutes to cover what happens between now and Election Day . 
1	49	 Remember when Trump said he would get rid of food regulations ? 
1	49	 That was Thursday . 
1	49	 Regardless , in the end , people are still gon na vote for this man . 
1	49	 Maybe not enough to get him elected , but still : it 'll be in the tens of millions . ( 
1	49	 Note to the people causing the polls to fluctuate : What the fuck is wrong with you ? 
1	49	" I got ta meet the five percent of people who saw Hillary come down with pneumonia and were like , "" Forget her , gimme the dictator with dryer lint hair . "" ) "
1	49	 Nothing that Trump says , no damning piece of Trump reportage , and certainly no opinion piece like this one will stop his voters from pulling the lever . 
1	49	 Nor will anything stop Trump from being the officious , braindead goon that he is . 
1	49	 He will never answer for his crimes , and there 's a frighteningly large portion of the electorate that will always love him for that . 
1	49	 And so I 'd just like to say to that portion of the electorate : Fuck you . 
1	49	 No , seriously . 
1	49	 Go fuck yourselves . 
1	49	 I 'm not gon na waste any more time trying to convince you that you 're about to do something you 'll regret forever .

1	49	 No no , this post is for ME . 
1	49	 I am preaching to the sad little choir in my soul here . 
1	49	 Because while Trump is a miserable bastard , YOU are the people who have handed him the bullhorn . 
1	49	 YOU are the people willing to embarrass this nation and put it on the brink of economic ruin all because you wanna throw an electoral hissy fit .

1	55	"Now that a federal judge has held Obama 's illegal "" executive amnesty "" unconstitutional , perhaps U.S. senators will remember that they swore to uphold the Constitution , too . "
1	55	" Back when they needed our votes before the last election , Republicans were hairy - chested warriors , vowing to block Obama 's unconstitutional "" executive amnesty "" -- if only voters gave them a Senate majority . "
1	55	 The resulting Republican landslide suggested some opposition to amnesty . 
1	55	 Heading into the election , college professor Dave Brat took out the sitting House majority leader and amnesty - supporter Eric Cantor in a primary , despite being outspent 40 - 1 . 
1	55	" It was the greatest upset in history since the 1980 "" Miracle on Ice "" at the Lake Placid Olympics : Never before has a House majority leader been defeated in a primary . "
1	55	 And Brat did it by an astonishing 55.5 percent to 45.5 percent . 
1	55	 Again , the voters seemed to be expressing disquiet with amnesty . 
1	55	 After that , even amnesty - supporting Sen. Lamar Alexander , R - Tenn . , 
1	55	" was denouncing Obama 's executive amnesty . "" "
1	55	" If the president were to do that , "" he said , "" and we have a Republican majority in the United States Senate , why , we have a number of options that we do n't now have to remind him to read Article I of the Constitution . "" "
1	55	 Poll after poll showed Americans ranking illegal immigration as the No . 
1	55	 1 most important problem facing the nation . 
1	55	 We have n't changed our minds . 
1	55	 Last week , an Associated Press - Gfk poll showed that Obama 's single most unpopular policy is his position on illegal immigration . 
1	55	 In other words , Obamacare is more popular than amnesty . 
1	55	 That 's like losing a popularity contest to Ted Bundy . 
1	55	 Since at least 2006 , voters have insistently told pollsters they do n't want amnesty . 
1	55	 Seemingly bulletproof Republican congressmen have lost their seats over amnesty . 
1	55	 President Bush lost the entire House of Representatives over amnesty . 
1	55	 What else do we have to do to convince you we do n't want amnesty , Republicans ? 
1	55	" Make it a host on "" The View "" ? "
1	55	" Before the election , then - Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell complained that Obama 's decision to delay his executive amnesty until after the election was a ploy to prevent Americans from "" hold(ing ) his party accountable in the November elections . "" "
1	55	 But voters went ahead and held Obama accountable ! 
1	55	 Now McConnell is Senate majority leader -- and he claims his hands are tied . 
1	55	" McConnell 's spokesman at the National Republican Senatorial Committee , Brad Dayspring , predicted that Obama 's amnesty threat would drive voters to "" elect a new Senate ( that ) will stand up to the president . "" "

1	55	 Hello ? 
1	55	 Hell - oooo ? 
1	55	" To gin up votes , "" Republican insiders "" told the Washington Examiner last fall that "" the results of the midterm elections "" would determine how "" aggressive "" the GOP would be in fighting Obama 's amnesty . "
1	55	 Voters gave you a blow - out victory , Republicans . 
1	55	 You cleaned their clocks . ( 
1	55	 Have you seen Harry Reid lately ? ) 
1	55	 Where 's that promised aggression on amnesty ? 
1	55	 Republicans and George Will tell us they ca n't stand up to Obama 's executive amnesty because the media are unfair . 
1	55	 Oh , well , in that case , never mind ! 
1	55	 This is news to them ? 
1	55	 They did n't know the media were unfair when they were promising to block Obama 's illegal amnesty before the elections ? 
1	55	 The media have blamed the GOP for every failure of Republicans and Democrats to reach an agreement since the Hoover administration . 
1	55	 This is n't a surprise development . 
1	55	 Why do n't Republicans attack the media ? 
1	55	 People hate the media ! 
1	55	 Their power is eroding -- and it would erode a lot faster if Congress would challenge them . 
1	55	 Instead of submitting to the media 's blackmail , my suggestion is , take their gun away . 
1	55	" Tell voters what the media wo n't : that Obama 's "" amnesty "" will give illegal aliens Social Security cards and three years of back - payments through the Earned Income Tax Credit , even though they never paid taxes in the first place . "
1	55	 Could we get a poll on that : Should the government issue work permits to illegal aliens and give them each $ 25,000 in U.S. taxpayer money ? 
1	55	 I promise you , Obama would lose that vote by at least 80 - 20 . 
1	55	 Even people who are against hounding illegal aliens out of the country are n't clamoring to open the U.S. Treasury to them . 
1	55	" Tell voters that the media are refusing to report on Senate Democrats ' weeks - long filibuster against a GOP bill that would defund Obama 's illegal "" amnesty . "" "
1	55	 Contrary to hysterical claims by the media and George Will , the government wo n't shut down if the Democrats ' filibuster goes on forever . 
1	55	 The government is funded ! 
1	55	" Only the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) will be "" defunded . "" "
1	55	 Which means , let 's see ... I 'm counting on my fingers ... yes , that 's right : NOTHING . 
1	55	" Nearly all DHS employees are deemed "" essential "" personnel who are required to stay on the job even if the department 's budget does n't pass -- the Secret Service , the Transportation Security Administration , the Federal Emergency Management Agency , Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard . "
1	55	" Approximately 200,000 of DHS 's 230,000 employees are required to keep working through what the media will hysterically call a "" government shutdown . "" "
1	55	" By "" government shutdown , "" the media mean : "" some secretaries will not go to work . "" "
1	55	 Why do n't Republicans spend all their airtime attacking the media for lying about what Obama 's amnesty does and what the Democrats are doing ? 
1	55	 It 's hard to avoid concluding that Republicans are n't trying to make the right arguments . 
1	55	 In fact , it kind of looks like they 're intentionally throwing the fight on amnesty . 
1	55	 If a Republican majority in both houses of Congress ca n't stop Obama from issuing illegal immigrants Social Security cards and years of back welfare payments , there is no reason to vote Republican ever again .

1	59	 Republicans are starting to talk openly about refusing to fill Antonin Scalia 's Supreme Court seat not only through the end of President Obama 's term but indefinitely . 
1	59	 Ted Cruz , Charles Grassley and John McCain have all sent such signals , as have some other prominent conservatives . 
1	59	 It 's worth taking this talk seriously . 
1	59	 Too many top Republicans have made clear in recent years that they care more about winning than about adhering to political norms or doing what 's best for the country . 
1	59	 You can see this attitude in the willingness to shut down the government , the threats to default on the national debt and the stated desire to make Obama a failed president . 
1	59	" The political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein call it "" asymmetric polarization "" : the two political parties have come to behave quite differently . "
1	59	 Refusing to seat a ninth justice , simply for ideological reasons , would be a clear and worrisome break with democratic tradition . 
1	59	 It would send the message that Republicans believe a president should be able to exercise the Constitutional power to name justices only if that president were Republican . 
1	59	 It would represent a new level of partisan cynicism . 
1	59	 I hope that the wiser heads within the Republican Party prevail after the election .

1	59	 The alternative would mean that Senate control — which remains up in the air , given the tightness of recent polls — will be crucial . 
1	59	 If Republicans hold the Senate , a President Hillary Clinton would be at their mercy with any nominee .

0	61	"Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos was an "" accomplice "" to Las Vegas Strip mass shooter Stephen Paddock . "
0	61	 On 5 October 2017 , the disreputable web site GotNews.com — run by notorious Internet troll Chuck C. Johnson — reported ( with no evidence or citations ) that the security guard being lauded as a hero for his role in helping to stop the massacre perpetrated by Las Vegas Strip shooter Stephen Paddock was , in fact , an accomplice in the shooting . 
0	61	 Stephen Paddock , 64 , has been named as the lone gunman by law enforcement in the 1 October 2017 mass shooting , in which he fired on a music festival crowd of 22,000 with a modified automatic weapon from a suite in the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino , killing 58 and wounding hundreds . 
0	61	 High - ranking officials from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department , the law enforcement agency leading the investigation , have said that while they still do n't know if Paddock had any accomplices in planning the attack , they have on several occasions confirmed that per their investigation , he was the only shooter . 
0	61	 Large - scale tragedies like mass shootings and terrorist attacks have been unfortunate lures for conspiracy theorists and purveyors of false information in the Internet age . 
0	61	" Disreputable web sites latch on to the chaotic aftermaths of such incidents to seduce audiences with "" alternatives "" to official investigations , claiming to harbor the "" truth "" that dishonest officials and the "" mainstream media "" are hiding from the public . "
0	61	 For example , GotNews stories carry this fundraising plug :

0	61	 If you 'd like to join our research team , contact editor@gotnews.com . 
0	61	" GotNews did n't provide in its story any evidence to support their claim that hotel security guard Jesus Campos was an accomplice , other than an anonymous "" official "" with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ( ATF ) . "
0	61	 GotNews reported : 
0	61	 The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives now believes Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock likely had help planning and executing the deadliest mass shooting in US history from none other than the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino security guard who was shot in the leg that night , a senior ATF official told GotNews . 
0	61	 Jesus Campos has been praised for his apparent heroics on October 1st , as he supposedly rushed to Paddock 's suite , was shot in the upper thigh through the door , and continued to help get people to safety despite his wounds . 
0	61	 However , a new report indicates the ATF now believes he was likely an accomplice of Paddock 's , and may have even been involved in the initial shooting as a second gunman from the other broken window in Paddock 's 32nd - floor room . 
0	61	" According to an ATF official , these suspicions are corroborated by the extreme amount of gunpowder residue found on Campos ' hands . "" "
0	61	" They believe he killed Paddock , shot holes through the door and his own arm to produce physical evidence for his cover story , then went and lay next to the elevator , "" a senior ATF official doing ballistic work for the shooting told GotNews . "
0	61	 The ATF contacted GotNews to notify them the story was inaccurate ; the story was then updated with this disclaimer : 
0	61	" The ATF has disputed GotNews ' source , saying "" the information in the article is incorrect , "" in the following article on a theory regarding the Las Vegas shooting . "" "
0	61	 Please know that the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department is the lead of the investigation of the shooting in Las Vegas and ATF is assisting . 
0	61	" This is an ongoing investigation where we continue to work with our law enforcement partners , "" the ATF said . "
0	61	 This article will continue to be updated with developments . 
0	61	 If you have any tips , email editor@gotnews.com 
0	61	" However , another disreputable web site , YourNewsWire.com , which regurgitated the GotNews story on 6 October 2017 , did not include this crucial "" update "" to alert readers that the allegations in the story were disputed by the very agency cited . "
0	61	 We followed up with the ATF to ask whether any of their employees had been in contact with GotNews . 
0	61	 The agency responded : 
0	61	 We do not believe that any ATF officials spoke to GotNews or mentioned to anyone that Mr. Campos was a second shooter . 
0	61	" We sent Johnson a detailed list of questions about the GotNews story , but Johnson only responded asking that we "" please print "" his claim to have a source with ATF . "
0	61	 We found no evidence to support stories that report Campos acted in any other way than heroically . 
0	61	 Campos has been hailed as a hero by the police department for not only locating Paddock 's room , but braving a hail of gunfire in doing so .. Police said Campos provided them with a door key to the suite and stayed to help them evacuate other guests until officers ordered him to seek medical aid for a gunshot wound to the leg ( there are no reports that Campos had a wound to his arm , as GotNews claims ) . 
0	61	 During a 4 October 2017 press conference , Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said : 
0	61	 But his [ Campos 's ] bravery was amazing because he remained with our officers , providing them the key pass to access the door , and actually continued to help them clear rooms until our officers demanded that he go seek medical attention . 
0	61	 In another update on 6 October 2017 , LVMPD Undersheriff Kevin McMahill reiterated that Campos 's actions were nothing other than heroic : 
0	61	 Most of you also now know the name of the Mandalay Bay security guard , who you 've all named in the media , and I 'll just reaffirm to you that Jesus Campos is a true hero . 
0	61	 I can tell you now just a little bit more that I know about what he did that particular day . 
0	61	 We now know that he was dispatched to what they call a door alarm on the 32nd floor . 
0	61	 He went up there to investigate the open door and as he was doing his job diligently , he came under fire by our suspect . 
0	61	 As you know , he was struck in the leg . 
0	61	 He turned around and retreated . 
0	61	 He notified his dispatch , which was absolutely critical to us knowing the location , as well as advising the responding officers as they arrived on that 32nd floor . 
0	61	 I can tell you that this was a remarkable effort by a brave and remarkable man . 
0	61	 I want to say today that I do n't think we 've done a good enough job recognizing him and his actions , and for that I apologize . 
0	61	 I just want to take the moment and clear the record that he 's an absolute hero . 
0	61	 This is not the first time Johnson has framed an innocent person ( a heroic one , no less ) in the aftermath of a deadly incident . 
0	61	 Dallas attorney Andrew Sommerman is representing in a pending defamation suit the family of Joel Vangheluwe , who Johnson wrongly identified as the driver of the Dodge Charger that ran down a group of counter - demonstrators at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville , Virginia in mid - August . 
0	61	 He said of Johnson : 
0	61	 When one does not care about the facts or how it affects people , it damages lives and creates a further disaster than what was originally created . 
0	61	" On 12 August 2017 , GotNews "" retracted "" the article naming Vangheluwe as the driver of the car that rammed into the crowd , leaving 32-year - old Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer dead , allegedly because the police had n't yet named a suspect . "
0	61	" Why GotNews backtracked in that case to defer to police but not in the case of Campos is unclear but accuracy does n't seem to have been the goal — as of 6 October 2017 , the GotNews story still says "" police have not identified the suspect , "" even though James Alex Fields was not only publicly identified but also charged with the crime the day the story was published . "
0	61	 Johnson , 28 , has a long and dizzying history of scandal as a semi - successful Internet troll . 
0	61	 He gained widespread notoriety when he attempted to out a woman who had anonymously written a disputed column about being raped on campus for Rolling Stone , but then identified the wrong woman . 
0	61	" In 2015 , he joined a short list of people banned by Twitter after a tweet asking supporters for funding to help "" take out "" civil rights activist DeRay McKession . "
0	61	 Johnson is also behind the crowdfunding web site WeSearchr , where he has raised funds for supporters of the neo - Nazi web site Daily Stormer and a movement of white supremacists who chartered ( then abandoned ) a ship in an effort to scuttle the efforts of aid organizations trying to rescue migrants making the deadly Mediterranean Sea crossing between North Africa and Europe . 
0	61	 During a press briefing on 9 October 2017 , Lombardo said investigators revised the shooting timeline , noting that Paddock shot Campos six minutes before he opened fire on the crowd . 
0	61	 Lombardo acknowledged that Campos was shot at 9:59 p.m. Responding to AP reporter Ken Ritter 's question , Lombardo said : 
0	61	 Yes , the timeline associated with the original shot and Mr. Campos has changed . 
0	61	 Through investigation , as I have conveyed to you from the very beginning , in your zest for information and my zest to ensure the public safety and the calming of their minds , is some things are going to change . 
0	61	 Now they are minute changes , OK . 
0	61	 There 's not this all - encompassing answer associated with the information that we presented before , in other words it 's not completely inaccurate , but what we have learned is Mr. Campos was encountered by the suspect prior to his [ Paddock 's ] shooting to the outside world . 
0	61	 Variations : On 12 October 2017 , readers asked about a purported CNN item reporting the claim as news : 
0	61	" Hello will you please tell me if the CNN report released today October 11th "" Breaking News - Police Arrest Mandalay Security Guard Jesus Compos As Second Shooter In Las Vegas Massacre "" is true or false ? "
0	61	 Thank you for your time 
0	61	 A fake news web site posing as CNN published an article reiterating the debunked rumor on 11 October 2017 : 
0	61	 Breaking News - Police Arrest Mandalay Security Guard Jesus Compos As Second Shooter In Las Vegas Massacre 
0	61	 CNN ) Breaking News - Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Compos has been arrested accused of being an accomplice and second shooter in the Las Vegas massacre that claimed the lives of 59 people and injured more than 500 . 
0	61	 Jesus Campos had originally been praised for his apparent heroics on October 1st , as he supposedly rushed to Paddock 's suite , was shot in the upper thigh through the door , and continued to help get people to safety despite his wounds . 
0	61	 However , FBI officials involved in the investigation now believe he was an accomplice of Paddock 's , and was involved in the initial shooting as a second gunman from the other broken window in Paddock 's 32nd - floor room . 
0	61	 The domain name ( cnn-internationaledition.com ) and use of CNN 's logos successfully duped social media users into believing the story was legitimate and sharing it . 
0	61	 Hosting records revealed that the site was registered on 10 October 2017 , one day prior to the publication of the article . 
0	61	 Additional registrar details indicated that the site was registered outside the United States by an individual , not CNN . 
0	61	 9 October 2017 , 5:10 P.M. : Added additional information that Campos was shot sooner than initially thought by investigators .

0	64	"Trump said the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with the Kremlin is "" phony , "" "" bad for our country , "" a "" witch hunt , "" and "" evil politics . "" ( "
0	64	 AP Photo/ Brennan Linsley ) 
0	64	 President Trump responded to reports that special counsel Robert Mueller is about to indict people in his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election by pointing the finger at Democrats . 
0	64	" Trump said the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with the Kremlin is "" phony , "" "" bad for our country , "" a "" witch hunt , "" and "" evil politics . "" "
0	64	 He added the news that Hillary Clinton 's campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for the unverified dossier alleging scandalous behavior by Trump has united Republicans . 
0	64	" "" Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier ( now $ 12,000,000 ? ) , "
0	64	" the Uranium to Russia deal , the 33,000 plus deleted Emails , the Comey fix and so much more , "" Trump tweeted . "
0	64	" "" Instead they look at phony Trump / Russia , ‘ collusion , ' which does n't exist . "
0	64	 The Dems are using this terrible ( and bad for our country ) Witch Hunt for evil politics , but the R 's are now fighting back like never before . 
0	64	 There is so much GUILT by Democrats / Clinton , and now the facts are pouring out . 
0	64	" DO SOMETHING ! "" "
0	64	 The $ 12 million figure refers to the amount of money Clinton 's campaign paid to Perkins and Cole , a law firm that then paid Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump . 
0	64	 Fusion GPS then paid former British spy Christopher Steele , who authored the dossier on Trump that was released shortly before the inauguration . 
0	64	 It 's not clear if all $ 12 million the Clinton campaign paid to the law firm went toward funding the dossier . 
0	64	 Trump was also referring to a deal between an American company and a Russian government agency to purchase the company , which controlled about 20 percent of the country 's uranium supply . 
0	64	 Clinton 's State Department was one of nine government agencies that signed off on the purchase , and that decision has come under new scrutiny after revelations that the FBI was investigating if Russians were trying to gain influence in the American uranium industry . 
0	64	 Later on , Trump added the new focus on the Russia investigation is likely a distraction from the Republican push for tax reform .

0	65	Robert Galbraith / flickr Since Facebook made it harder for publishers to spread their articles organically , various types of sponsored posts have begun to show up with more prominence . 
0	65	 This has gotten a bit confusing for users , as it 's hard to tell which underlying articles are pieces of journalism and which are advertisements . 
0	65	" We break down how to tell the difference between various types of "" sponsored "" posts on Facebook . "
0	65	 It used to be pretty easy to tell the difference between advertising and editorial content on Facebook . 
0	65	" If a post had a little "" sponsored "" label on it , that was a red flag telling you , "" Hey , a brand paid for this , you should treat it as an advertisement . "" "
0	65	" But that line has gotten blurrier for Facebook users , especially over the last few months as Facebook has limited how far posts from media companies can spread on their own ( so - called "" organic reach "" ) . "
0	65	" In January , Facebook announced that it would de - emphasize publisher content in favor of "" friends and family "" posts . "
0	65	" One of the main complaints I heard from folks on the publisher side was that Mark Zuckerberg did n't actually want less publisher content on Facebook : He wanted publishers to pay him to help their articles spread . "" "
0	65	" Facebook is now pay to play , "" was a lament I heard many times . "
0	65	 And that is what many publishers - from The New Yorker , to The Wall Street Journal , to Marie Claire ( and Business Insider ) - have been doing for certain articles , with more frequency since the algorithm change . 
0	65	 They have paid Facebook to help their editorial , journalistic articles spread . 
0	65	" The Facebook posts that link to these articles are labeled "" sponsored , "" because they are technically ads , but they link to normal news articles . "
0	65	" When you follow the link to the publisher 's website , the article is n't a piece of "" sponsored content , "" even though the Facebook post is labeled "" sponsored . "" "
0	65	 Confusing , right ? 
0	65	 But that 's only the start of the rabbit hole when it comes to the blurring of the lines between advertising and editorial content on Facebook . 
0	65	" Traditionally , media companies have worked to separate advertisements from journalistic writing ( and to properly label "" advertorial "" content ) . "
0	65	 But in the world of Facebook , these outlets do n't always even have control over how posts appear to readers . 
0	65	 Positive articles about companies like Uber ( for instance ) are being turned into promotional ads , sometimes without the media organizations being made aware . 
0	65	 It can be hard for readers to wade through , so we decided to break it down for you in a way that is easy to digest . 
0	65	" We 'll walk you through the various types of "" sponsored "" posts on Facebook and what they mean . "
0	65	 When the outlet pays to spread it 
0	65	" Let 's start with the one I just mentioned : Purely editorial articles that are being promoted with "" sponsored "" posts on Facebook . "
0	65	 This basically happens when a publisher wants to boost an article it thinks has viral potential , and can bring the publisher in much more advertising ( or subscriber ) revenue than it is paying Facebook to push it into your feed , or get new readers . 
0	65	" Here is what that looks like from The New Yorker on an editorial article titled "" The Great Sadness of Ben Affleck "" : "
0	65	 Nathan McAlone / Facebook 
0	65	" And here 's one from The Wall Street Journal on an editorial article titled "" Silicon Valley to Washington : Why Do n't You Get Us "" : "
0	65	 Nathan McAlone / Facebook 
0	65	 Just scrolling through my Facebook feed casually , I noticed many such articles from outlets ranging from those above to Marie Claire ( as mentioned ) , Ranker , Screen Rant , Elite Daily , U.S. News and World Report , and so on . 
0	65	 They really run the gamut editorially . 
0	65	 Okay , so this type of post is easy enough to understand . 
0	65	 When the subject pays to spread it 
0	65	 Here is where it starts to get more confusing . 
0	65	 Sometimes , the subject of an article pays Facebook to promote an editorial article written about them - presumably one that paints them in a positive light . 
0	65	" These are also technically "" ads "" on Facebook , but the journalism they are promoting was not paid for by the subject . "
0	65	" The article itself is not "" sponsored content , "" even though the Facebook post is "" sponsored . "" "
0	65	 Here 's an example with Uber and CNET : 
0	65	" CNET wrote this article about Uber 's new CEO , titled "" Uber 's U - turn : How the new CEO is cleaning house after scandals and lawsuits . "" "
0	65	 To be clear , this was written by a reporter at CNET and was not paid for by Uber . 
0	65	 It 's just a regular news article . 
0	65	 But Uber clearly liked the piece and is now paying Facebook to spread it far and wide . 
0	65	 Here is an example from the video world . 
0	65	 This editorial video ( not an ad ) by NowThis Money is being promoted by the subject of the video , Adam Khafif . 
0	65	" Adam Khafif 's Facebook page is sharing a NowThis Money post from its Facebook page , and that share is being "" sponsored "" ( i.e. boosted by paying money to Facebook ) . "
0	65	 See , it gets very convoluted . 
0	65	" But the main point is that the underlying video , and in this case even the underlying original Facebook post , is n't an ad - but the subject of the video is paying for a "" sponsored "" Facebook post to promote it . "
0	65	" Sometimes these "" sponsored "" posts are even geo - targeted , like the one on this article from The New Yoker titled "" Divinity on the Dance Floor , "" which is being "" promoted "" not even by its subject ( DJ Robert Hood ) , but by the nightclub where he performs regularly ( Schimanski ) : "
0	65	 When the outlet pays an influencer to spread it 
0	65	 Now let 's get to influencers and celebrities . 
0	65	 Sometimes publishers pay influencers ( people with big Facebook followings ) to promote their articles . 
0	65	 This used to be done a lot through organic Facebook reach ( here 's an article on this about George Takei . ) 
0	65	" But now I 've only seen it recently in the form of "" sponsored "" posts . "
0	65	 Here 's an example from Snoop Dogg and FashionBeans : 
0	65	" Snoop Dogg in this instance is technically paying Facebook to promote an article from FashionBeans , titled "" Here Are The Most Obnoxiously Rich Suburbs Of America 's Biggest Cities , "" that really has nothing to do with him . "
0	65	 But most likely what is happening is that FashionBeans is paying him to promote it , then he is paying Facebook . 
0	65	 So the idea is that while FashionBeans could directly pay Facebook to promote the post , the promotion is more effective ( dollar for dollar ) if Snoop Dogg 's name is attached . 
0	65	 When an advertiser pays for the actual article 
0	65	" Now we get to the last category : actual "" sponsored content "" from a media company . "
0	65	" This is an instance of "" advertorial , "" where the advertiser is directly paying the media company to sponsor the actual article itself . "
0	65	 Here 's an example from BuzzFeed and NBC Sports : 
0	65	" In these cases , the word "" with "" is usually employed in the Facebook post to denote which company is paying for the underlying content . "
0	65	 It 's marked again if you follow the link to BuzzFeed 's site : 
0	65	" Notice that the "" Brand Publisher "" is NBC Sports . "
0	65	 So this is actually an ad - not only on Facebook but on BuzzFeed 's site as well . 
0	65	 And there you have it , we 've come to the end of our guide to understanding who is paying to get journalism or advertising in front of you on Facebook . 
0	65	" One last thing to remember is that no matter who is paying for a "" sponsored "" Facebook post - outlet , subject , or influencer - if you check the actual article after following the link , it should clearly mark whether the article is an advertisement or a journalistic piece . "

0	66	Terry Crews , photographed Nov. 2017 . 
0	66	 Billy & Hells for TIME 
0	66	 When dozens of women came forward with sexual assault and harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein — who has continued to deny all allegations of non - consensual sex — actor Terry Crews noticed that some people on Twitter were skeptical . 
0	66	 Crews knows from personal experience how hard it is to experience harassment and muster the courage to speak out : He says he was groped by William Morris Endeavor agent Adam Venit at an industry event in front of his wife . 
0	66	 The agency said they suspended and demoted Venit , who declined to comment for this article . 
0	66	 He has since returned to work . 
0	66	 Crews is now suing Venit and the agency for sexual assault . 
0	66	 Crews — who was recognized as one of the Silence Breakers , TIME 's Person of the Year — realized that men had a responsibility to lend credence and support to these women 's claims . 
0	66	 Almost without thinking through the consequences , Crews tweeted out his own story ; in his viral series of tweets , he became one of the first men to join the chorus of women speaking out about harassment . 
0	66	 Crews spoke to TIME about the reception to his story and why it 's imperative that men advocate for women 's rights . 
0	66	 What was the moment you decided to speak out about what happened to you ? 
0	66	 I 'd actually just read a comment someone made on Twitter about one of Weinstein 's accusers . 
0	66	 It went something like : She 's just looking for attention and a payday . 
0	66	 It really affected me . 
0	66	 I could n't stop thinking about it . 
0	66	 I remember going to my phone and I started writing . 
0	66	 And I could n't stop . 
0	66	 What it became was this sixteen - tweet missive from me . 
0	66	 I just remember having to say what I felt . 
0	66	 I was really angry because these women were being discounted . 
0	66	 These women were being discarded . 
0	66	 Their pain was just — it was nothing . 
0	66	 I wanted to join in . 
0	66	 I wanted to say something . 
0	66	 I wanted to support . 
0	66	 But I did have to let these women know they were n't alone . 
0	66	 And that I understood . 
0	66	 My whole mission was to give them strength . 
0	66	 Do n't accept the shame that people are giving you . 
0	66	 Because that 's what it was . 
0	66	 They were being shamed . 
0	66	 They were being victimized again . 
0	66	 I just could n't stand for it .

0	66	 What was the reaction like ? 
0	66	 In a matter of hours it had become the # 1 trending topic on Twitter . 
0	66	 And I had a realization : I did n't check with my wife , I did n't check with my publicist , I did n't check with anybody . 
0	66	 I just did it . 
0	66	 But at that moment , I was free . 
0	66	" Until men stand up and say , "" This harassment , this abuse , these assaults are wrong , "" nothing will change . "
0	66	 If I was silent , it would mean I 'm consenting to all of it . 
0	66	 I always have felt women have been able to take care of themselves , 100 % . 
0	66	 But men need to hold other men accountable . 
0	66	 That 's my thing . 
0	66	 I came up in the cult of masculinity , in football and the sports world and entertainment . 
0	66	 You 're in places and guys are saying the wildest thing . 
0	66	 People need to be called on that . 
0	66	 You need to be held accountable for the things you say , the things you do . 
0	66	 What it came from is literally a belief that as a man you are more valuable than a woman . 
0	66	 The reason I have the authority to say it is because I was like it . 
0	66	 I truly believed I was more valuable than my wife and kids . 
0	66	 Until I had a major paradigm shift in my own life — it was like I hit rock bottom in order for me to see that I had it all wrong . 
0	66	 I 'm here to tell you it 's not your fault . 
0	66	 It 's not . 
0	66	 What happened to me was a prime example . 
0	66	" People were saying , "" You should have beat him up . "" "
0	66	" I 'm like , "" Why is no one questioning him ? "" "
0	66	 No one questions the predator . 
0	66	 The person who is doing the harassment does n't even get a question . 
0	66	 You know why ? 
0	66	 Because they just expect it . 
0	66	" And I said , "" No more . "" "
0	66	 Why are you questioning the victim here ? 
0	66	 Let 's flip it . 
0	66	 What would you say to people who think this is becoming a witch hunt ? 
0	66	 Hollywood was so far into the fact that everyone thought this behavior is normal . 
0	66	 It needs to swing all the way back . 
0	66	 What we need is a reset . 
0	66	" People say , "" Oh , it 's a witch hunt . "
0	66	" People could lie . "" "
0	66	 You know what ? 
0	66	 First of all , the thread of that is going to keep people right .

0	71	A photograph shows a black police officer protecting participants in a white supremacist protest in Charlottesville . 
0	71	 On 12 August 2017 , just after the occurrence of violent and tragic events at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville , Virginia , left multiple people dead , an image was widely circulated via social media seemingly showing a black police officer calmly standing guard to protect a group of racist protesters carrying Confederate flags , wearing Ku Klux Klan garb , and issuing Nazi salutes : 
0	71	 Although this photograph was genuine , it was not — as was widely assumed ( or stated ) in social media posts — a picture snapped at the 12 August 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville . 
0	71	 The image had been posted online well over a month earlier , as shown in this 9 July 2017 tweet from Tucson , Arizona , police chief Chris Magnus :

0	71	" "" On Monday I saw a photo from the KKK rally that moved me and I posted it . "
0	71	 Now it has gone viral and mean , angry people are coming out of the woodwork . 
0	71	 I do not care about the rude comments towards me but I am becoming quite irritated at the attacks on our local police officer . 
0	71	 He is getting attacked for being an African American police officer who was protecting the free speech rights of the klan and I am getting accused of being a supporter of racism because my sister is a police officer .

0	71	 The image originated with a Ku Klux Klan rally held in downtown Charlottesville on 8 July 2017 :

0	71	" That afternoon , she positioned herself near an area that had been cordoned off "" in anticipation of what might unfold . "" "
0	71	" She purposefully stayed in front of the officer , waiting for what she felt was the right moment that captured the "" bizarre "" scene that was unfolding . "
0	71	" Once the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan arrived , she recalled "" a huge surge of people behind me . "" "

1	74	Their ideological vanities are under threat as never before . 
1	74	 The chronic weakness of their regime has been further exposed by the triumph of a US presidential candidate who does not share their devotion to open borders , the destruction of national identities and the march of globalisation . 
1	74	 What makes Trump 's victory all the more chilling for EU leaders is that he looks certain to be a strong ally of Britain as we regain our independence . 
1	74	 Ever since the referendum , the Brussels elite has comforted itself with the illusion that Britain outside the EU will be left hopelessly isolated . 
1	74	" The Eurocrats and their Remain cheerleaders in Britain were only too thrilled when President Obama arrogantly warned that , in the event of Brexit , we would have to "" get to the back of the queue "" for any future trade deal with the US . "
1	74	 Donald Trump 's victory has shaken up the world 
1	74	 But the arrival of Donald Trump has transformed the landscape . 
1	74	 He is far closer to Britain than to Brussels . 
1	74	 It is the EU that will have to get to the back of the queue . 
1	74	 Tellingly , the first European politician that Trump has met since his election was Nigel Farage , the EU 's nemesis . 
1	74	 The deepening sense of alarm in Brussels was reflected in the decision by the EU 's foreign affairs chief , Italian socialist Federica Mogherini , to summon all the foreign ministers of the member states to a special dinner last night to discuss the implications of Trump 's election . 
1	74	" As one European diplomat admitted at the weekend : "" We would never have held a similar dinner if Hillary Clinton had been elected . "
1	74	" It shows how much we are panicking . "" "
1	74	 Sensibly our own Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson refused to attend this self - indulgent feast of grief . 
1	74	" With his gift for the original phrase , he urged EU bosses stop wallowing in their "" collective whinge - o - rama "" and come to terms with the democratic verdict of the American people . "
1	74	 EU leaders are too deep in their dogma to properly respond to Trump 's presidency 
1	74	 Yet , in truth , the EU politicians are so manically attached to their federalist dogma that they would not dream of adopting a pragmatic , flexible response to Trump . 
1	74	" On the contrary , they will just use Trump 's success to push for more central power , more integration , more unity . "" "
1	74	" The EU should treat his election as a wake - up call to take charge of our own destiny , "" says Guy Verhofstadt , the Belgian federalist fanatic . "
1	74	 The EU will this week discuss plans to impose a European defence strategy , complete with its own EU army and military headquarters . 
1	74	 It is precisely that kind of federalist megalomania which shows why Brussels is such a threat to the stability and peace of Europe , a far greater menace than Trump ever could be . 
1	74	 Ever since Trump first became a contender for the US presidency there has been a fashionable narrative which paints him as a dangerous , ignorant clown who could blow up the western world with his reckless inexperience . 
1	74	 But the real risks actually come from smug globalisers such as Hillary Clinton and the EU federalists with their contempt for national sovereignty at home and abroad . 
1	74	 The president - elect has a chance of establishing peace with Russia 
1	74	 It was the EU , filled with an imperialist ambition to expand its territory , that provoked an incendiary confrontation with Russia over Ukraine , whereas Trump wants co - operation with Putin . 
1	74	 Similarly , the western policy of trying to bring down President Assad of Syria with the help of Islamic extremist rebels has only prolonged the civil war there . 
1	74	 It will be no surprise if the war ends once Trump takes office , enabling Putin and Assad to crush the rebels . 
1	74	" In the wake of Trump 's victory the head of Nato Jens Stoltenberg said that "" we face the greatest challenges to our security in a generation "" . "
1	74	 But why is that ? 
1	74	 It is because the pathetic , supine ruling classes of Europe have allowed our enemies to flourish in our midst . 
1	74	 They are destroying our civilisation from within . 
1	74	 Through their fixation with free movement they have promoted the import of Islamic extremism and terrorism on an epic scale , while their ruthlessly imposed doctrine of cultural diversity has meant continual appeasement of Muslim militancy . 
1	74	" Trump wants to challenge the jihadists : figures such as Mogherini , a Communist in her youth , just want to surrender to them . "" "
1	74	" Islam is a victim "" and "" belongs in Europe "" , she proclaims . "
1	74	 The EU brought chaos upon Europe , not Donald Trump 
1	74	 EU policy , not Trump , has brought squalor , social breakdown , organised misogyny and financial chaos to Europe . 
1	74	 The filthy migrant squatter camps in France and the predatory sex attacks in Germany are the twin symbols of the nightmare that Brussels has inflicted on the continent . 
1	74	 By condemning patriotism , undermining solidarity and slashing military spending , Europe 's politicians have left the member states defenceless . 
1	74	 And can the same rulers hector Trump about American isolationism when they refused to take any serious responsibility for the strength of their countries ' own armed forces ? 
1	74	 Trump has a mandate from the American people . 
1	74	 Unelected and unaccountable , EU President Jean - Claude Juncker and his crew have no such democratic legitimacy . 
1	74	" Juncker sneered last week that "" we need to teach the President - elect what Europe is and how it works "" . "
1	74	 But it does n't work . 
1	74	 The entire EU project has been a catastrophic failure .EU is much more dangerous than Donald Trump , says Leo McKinstry

0	77	 You are very special , according to science . 
0	77	 Throughout history , being left - handed has been viewed as a weakness or something to overcome . 
0	77	 Heck , just 20 years ago , studies said that left - handed people die sooner and were prone to more accidents . 
0	77	 Why ? 
0	77	 It 's not your fault , lefties — you're living in a world built for right - handed people ! 
0	77	 Doors are made for the right hand .

0	77	 Even writing can be more of a challenge for lefties .

0	77	 And , it turns out , there are some serious perks to being a leftie — including a higher likelihood of excelling at sports and better problem - solving skills ( take that , righties ! ) . 
0	77	 Read on for some fun facts about and great perks of being left - handed . 
0	77	 San Diego Padres v Arizona Diamondbacks by Darin Wallentine / Getty Images Sport 1 . 
0	77	 We Do n't Know Why Left - Handed People Exist 
0	77	 In spite of a good deal of research over the years , there still is n't a definitive answer as to why some humans are left - handed . 
0	77	 It could be partly hereditary from the mother 's side of the family tree . 
0	77	 Another theory is that if there is more testosterone in the womb , there 's a greater chance the baby will be left - handed . 
0	77	 In one study , twins were twice as likely to be left - handed as compared to the rest of the world . 
0	77	 2 . 
0	77	 We Do n't Know Exactly How Many Left - Handed People Are On Earth 
0	77	 Various studies estimate that between 5 and 26 percent of the population is left - handed . 
0	77	 But those numbers vary depending on culture and region being studied .

0	77	 Lefties Are More Likely To Be Good At Sports 
0	77	" About 25 percent of all MLB players are left - handed ( or "" southpaws "" ) . "
0	77	 And baseball 's not the only sport that 's advantageous for lefties . 
0	77	 Interactive sports like tennis give lefties the upper hand . 
0	77	 In fact , one report showed a whopping 40 percent of top tennis players are left - handed . 
0	77	 Since left - handed athletes ' movements are different , opponents are n't used to reacting to them . 
0	77	 Athletes are built on routines , and when you disrupt their routine , it throws off their game . 
0	77	 4 . 
0	77	 Left - Handedness Has Never Become Extinct 
0	77	 Back in the day , left - handed students were forced to write with their right hands in an attempt to correct what was seen as a problem . 
0	77	 Even with these questionable practices going on , the trait of left - handedness has not died . 
0	77	" Instead of survival of the fittest , left - handedness is sort of a "" survival of the unexpected . "" "
0	77	 For instance , in primitive cultures , 27 percent of people living in war - like regions were left - handed , compared to 3 percent in peaceful regions . 
0	77	 Perhaps that 's because the right - handed fighters never saw the left hook coming .

0	77	 Left - Handers Are Better Problem Solvers 
0	77	 Scientists believe lefties are better at divergent thinking , or coming up with multiple solutions to a problem . 
0	77	 As a result , they are more likely than right - handed counterparts to pursue careers in science , art and technology . 
0	77	 Famous lefties who made names for themselves in those fields include Marie Curie , Ludwig Van Beethoven , Pablo Picasso , Bob Dylan , Paul McCartney , Bill Gates , Julia Roberts , Angelina Jolie , Nicole Kidman and Jean - Paul Gaultier — an impressive lineup !

1	78	Ashley Judd is the absolute worst . 
1	78	 I want to like her , I really do . 
1	78	 Sometimes she chooses a good cause , like speaking up for trafficked and abused children . 
1	78	 Those are the activities she should stick to . 
1	78	" Unfortunately , Judd had to go to the "" Women 's March , "" where hundreds of thousands of women wore pink "" pussy "" hats while claiming to be upset that Trump had used that word once . "
1	78	 She performed ridiculous slam poetry , screeching defamatory accusations about the president wanting to have sex with his daughter and about other terrible things about which she had no first - hand knowledge . ( 
1	78	 You can watch the video below if you have the stomach for it . ) 
1	78	 But at no time did she ever discuss a man who she did know did horrific things . 
1	78	" No "" by the way , Harvey Weinstein is a dirtbag who tried to get me to watch him shower for a part . "" "
1	78	 Why did n't that come up ? 
1	78	 I find it very difficult to believe Judd is this angry at Donald Trump , a man who has never done anything to her , or provably to anybody , when there is a man who did do something horrible to her whom she could be screeching about . 
1	78	 She needs therapy . 
1	78	 And possibly tranquilizers .

1	78	 I felt like I had a voice , people look at me and listen to me , and to not say anything , that 's never sat well with me . 
1	78	 That seems disingenuous , because she kept quiet about the creepy mogul who everyone in Hollywood appears to have known was abusing women . 
1	78	 Why stay quiet over that ? 
1	78	 Do n't you have a responsibility to alert other women that there is a serial sexual predator in their midst ? 
1	78	 Lawrence has n't alleged any harassment from Weinstein , although she is seen looking awkward in many photos with him while he holds her too close to his massive girth . 
1	78	 It would n't surprise me if she had first - hand knowledge of his depravity . 
1	78	 Gwyneth Paltrow is the most apolitical in this list . 
1	78	 While she supported Obama , she never had anything more interesting to say beyond how handsome she thinks he is . 
1	78	 Mostly she spends her life divorcing people and selling outrageously priced trinkets to rich women online .

0	87	GOP congressional candidate Paul Nehlen has drawn on anti - Semitic sympathy to rally support for his fledgling campaign , BuzzFeed News reported Friday . 
0	87	 Nehlen — who is running against House Speaker Paul Ryan ( R - Wis . ) 
0	87	 in a Republican primary this summer — ran a Twitter group chat where he rallied white nationalists to attack his opponents , BuzzFeed News reported . 
0	87	" One of Nehlen 's stated adversaries was the "" Jewish media , "" who he believed had "" coordinated "" to smear him after he lost the support of Breitbart News for sending tweets about white pride . "
0	87	 Nehlen 's list of targets included conservative personality John Cardillo , author Kurt Schlichter , and former Boston Red Sox pitcher turned Breitbart radio host Curt Schilling . 
0	87	 All three men , BuzzFeed News notes , are conservatives who distanced themselves from Nehlen . 
0	87	" The candidate turned to his Twitter group to ask for some backup , writing , "" Cardillo and others like him are working for Jewish media . "
0	87	" Then , there are the fake conservatives who happen to be Jewish . "" "
0	87	" Per screenshots published by BuzzFeed News , Nehlen then added : "" I 'm going to decimate them all . "
0	87	" And y' all are gon na help me . "" "
0	87	" Sources who spoke to BuzzFeed News said that "" such requests were common "" from Nehlen . "

1	88	Paula Jones , Monica Lewinsky , Gennifer Flowers 
1	88	 Early this year , Donald Trump made the seemingly audacious suggestion that Hillary Clinton was somehow responsible for Bill Clinton 's infidelities . 
1	88	" Trump called her an "" enabler "" and said she "" attacked the women who Bill Clinton mistreated afterward . "" "
1	88	 In typical Trump fashion , the comment was designed to get attention . 
1	88	" Mrs Clinton has been a champion of family issues and women 's rights throughout her career , so the idea that she was the enabler of someone Mr Trump has called "" the greatest abuser of women in the history of politics , "" appeared outrageous . "
1	88	 And yet , something resonated in Mr Trump 's description of Hillary . 
1	88	 There was a kernel of truth to his claim and now it is hurting Mrs Clinton with young female voters . 
1	88	 The New York Times today has a long article outlining Mrs Clinton 's role in the political handling of her husband 's sexual affairs . 
1	88	 It 's pretty damning , and for Clinton 's supporters it must make unpleasant reading . 
1	88	 Anyone with an iota of empathy , of course , sympathises with what Hillary Clinton went through during the Lewinsky scandal . 
1	88	 I was here and covered the story . 
1	88	 It was grim , and the image of Chelsea steadfastly holding both parents hands as they walked , heads slightly bowed , to the helicopter on their way to that summer holiday in Martha 's Vineyard will stick with me as one of the more poignant family portraits ever taken . 
1	88	 Dealing with a spouse 's unfaithfulness is traumatic in private . 
1	88	 It must be an even deeper circle of Hell when splashed on the front of every newspaper . 
1	88	 What is disconcerting now , however , is Hillary 's role in pursuing the women themselves - Gennifer , Paula , Monica , they all , according to both the New York Times and previously published accounts , became the subject of brutal , organised discreditation campaigns . 
1	88	" In 1992 , Hillary told Esquire magazine that if she had the chance to cross examine Flowers , she would "" crucify her . "" "
1	88	 Taking such determined steps to destroy a woman 's reputation in order to protect her husband 's political career smacks of depressingly cynical calculation . 
1	88	 The Clintons hired a famous private investigator to dig up the women 's pasts with the aim of destroying their reputations . 
1	88	 It is not clear from the Times ' reporting to what degree Mrs Clinton favoured this tough approach . 
1	88	 Did she drive it or just give it an accepting nod ? 
1	88	 Maybe the more relevant point is that she condoned it . 
1	88	" Hillary also famously called Ms Lewinsky a "" narcissistic loony toon , "" according to a friend 's testimony . "
1	88	" A staff member who was close to Hillary said she referred to Mr Clinton 's affairs as "" bimbo eruptions "" . "
1	88	 And there 's the problem for young women voters . 
1	88	 Why should the character or the sexual past of these women be relevant to the truthfulness of their claims ? 
1	88	 Indeed , Mr Clinton went on to confess to affairs with both Ms Flowers and Ms Lewinsky , after initially denying them . 
1	88	 By discrediting the women , the Clintons were spreading the subliminal message that it was somehow their fault more than Bill 's . 
1	88	 What were they trying to prove - that he was led astray by sexual predators ? 
1	88	 In 2016 that sounds grotesque . 
1	88	 How it all started for Hillary Clinton How it all started for Hillary Clinton 
1	88	 Today 's sexual mores are very different from the 1980s and 1990s . 
1	88	 Young women today expect women to stand up for other women , particularly in the area of sexual relations and particularly when those sexual relations involve a very powerful man and a younger woman . 
1	88	 Younger women who have been through bruising college sexual abuse scandals across America have little tolerance for women who in any way cast blame on the victim . 
1	88	 That empathy extends to consensual affairs - they just do n't like women shaming other women . 
1	88	 Which is exactly what Hillary Clinton was complicit in doing , according to the New York Times , and other previous accounts . 
1	88	 Mrs Clinton 's supporters say this is all old news , and is part of a right - wing attempt to slime her . 
1	88	 Many millennial voters were n't even born when Monica and Bill were cavorting in the Oval Office . 
1	88	 This is their first introduction to this sordid story . 
1	88	 However the Clinton campaign tries to spin it , it just does n't look great for their candidate .Hillary 's campaign and Bill 's women
0	89	Athletes choosing to kneel during the national anthem is currently a controversial topic in the US . 
0	89	 The this past weekend , 27 players from the Jacksonville Jaguars and Baltimore Ravens opted to take a knee during the singing of the US national anthem before a game at Wembley Stadium in London . 
0	89	 This was the most players ever to kneel during the national anthem in a single NFL game ever . 
0	89	 The defiant stance has become a sign of protest against racial inequality within the US , and more recently , against President Trump 's lacklustre response to the Charlottesville white - nationalist rally last month , and the heated aftermath that followed . 
0	89	" The defiant stance first made national news following a preseason game in 2016 , when Colin Kaepernick sat down ( as opposed to the tradition of standing ) , during the playing of "" The Star - Spangled Banner "" . "
0	89	 His reasoning was divisive , but simple : 
0	89	" "" I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color . "
0	89	 To me , this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way . 
0	89	" There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder "" "
0	89	 Eventually , Kaepernick conversed with former NFL player and US military veteran , Nate Boyer , and they both agreed that kneeling would be a much more respectful way to protest , whilst still showing respect for those who have fought in the US military . 
0	89	 But the Jaguars and the Ravens were n't the only NFL teams to show solidarity against President Trump this week . 
0	89	 The Pittsburgh Steelers , Oakland Raiders , Washington Redskins and more all protested in one way or another - with the Seattle Seahawks and Tennessee Titans even choosing to remain their locker rooms during the playing of the national anthem . 
0	89	 And yet , what 's even more inflammatory is President Trump 's reaction to the silent protests . 
0	89	" Instead of addressing the issues of racial injustice , Trump has hit out at the NFL , stating that fans should "" refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country "" , and that any players who take a knee should be fired or suspended . "
0	89	 But President Trump is n't the only fan tuning in every week to witness the protests . 
0	89	 Young children are incredibly impressionable , and one six - year - old in particular decided to demonstrate a protest of his own during the pledge of allegiance at his elementary school . 
0	89	 As reported on ABC Action News , a six - year - old boy in Pasco County knelt down during a reading of the pledge of allegiance - an action that his teacher found disrespectful of the country , and disrespectful of the flag . 
0	89	" The teacher send a text message to the boy 's mother , informing her , "" I knew where he had seen it . "
0	89	" But I did tell him that in the classroom , we are learning what it means to be a good citizen "" . "
0	89	" The teacher then told the child to "" stand up and stop it "" , something that the boy 's mother does not believe is her "" right "" . "
0	89	 The boy 's mother said that she did not tell her son to take a knee , but also does not want her son to be silenced . 
0	89	" She is now asking the school to be more open - minded , as she believes the issue is "" much bigger "" than her son . "
0	89	" Linda Cobbe of Pasco County schools stated that they follow state law , and that the only way a student can be exempted from reciting the pledge of allegiance is with a written request from the parents , and even then , "" they must stand "" . "
0	89	 Cobbe also agreed that a more beneficial approach would have been to pull the boy to the side of the class and discuss the matter , instead of punishing him in front of the other students . 
0	89	" But the mother believes that this should n't just be about her son : "" The bigger issue is cultural . "
0	89	" They have demonstrated to me , through multiple incidents , that they do n't take inclusion and diversity serious "" . "
0	89	" Both the boy 's mom and the school are now hoping that the incident will be something everyone can learn from , as the school "" does not want to infringe on anyone 's rights "" . "
0	89	 What do you think ? 
0	89	 Should the boy and his mother be punished ? 
0	89	 Was it simply just a child copying something his favorite football team did one TV , or was he fighting for his right to be heard and respected in the community ? 
0	89	 One thing is for sure , the actions of the NFL are being seen and heard across the nation by everyone .Six - Year - Old Is Punished By School For Kneeling During The Pledge Of Allegiance
1	90	Donald Trump fully embraced his inner neocon before the United Nations today . 
1	90	 He lashed out at North Korea , indicating that he was ready to ‘ totally destroy ' it . 
1	90	 He upbraided Iran as a corrupt and malignant regime that had taken America and its allies to the cleaners with the nuclear deal—'One of the worst and most one - sided transactions . ' 
1	90	 And for good measure , he scoffed at various socialist regimes around the globe . 
1	90	 The only term missing in his dyspeptic assessment of the carnage around the world was ‘ axis of evil , ' the phrase that George W. Bush made famous when he decried Iran , North Korea and Iraq after the 9/11 attacks . 
1	90	 The language he deployed was seldom less than apocalyptic . 
1	90	 Like Bush , he embraced the tone of moral superiority : ‘ If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few , then evil will triumph . ' 
1	90	 When it was not chiliastic , Trump indulged in snark , referring to ‘ Rocket Man ' as being on a ‘ suicide mission . ' 
1	90	 There can be no doubting that the regimes Trump referred to are as nasty as they come . 
1	90	 But enmeshing America in an Asian land war would surpass any of the follies that it has experienced in the Middle East . 
1	90	 Russia and China can only hope that Washington becomes stuck in another unwinnable war . 
1	90	 What served America well during the cold war was n't overt confrontation such as in Vietnam , but the strategy of containment . 
1	90	 Certainly Trump 's speech fitted with the desire he is now expressing to stage a massive military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue on 4 July to match , or even surpass , the festivities surrounding the Bastille Day parade that left him agog this past July in Paris , where he was the guest of Emmanuel Macron . 
1	90	 One problem is that the avenue is n't actually strong enough to withstand the weight of tanks rolling over it . 
1	90	 Never mind . 
1	90	 For Trump , these are mere details . 
1	90	 He has apparently become enamoured by a vision of a militarised America that can set wrong aright abroad , whenever and wherever it pleases . 
1	90	 His bellicosity is discordant , however , with the more isolationist America First doctrines that he brayed about during the presidential campaign . 
1	90	 America First has been converted into a bellicose unilateralism . 
1	90	 If anything , it sounds like neocon 2.0 . 
1	90	 It was notable that during his speech at the UN , Trump veered from claiming , on the one hand , that it was imperative to respect the national sovereignty of individual nations to alleging , on the other , that there is no burking the necessity of taking out regimes that he , and he alone , deems inimical to American interests and values . 
1	90	 What about the country that meddled with the 2016 American elections , thereby violating the precious sovereignty Trump dwelled upon ? 
1	90	 There was nary a word about Russia . 
1	90	 The most that can be hoped for with Trump 's speech is that it was simply more rodomontade . 
1	90	 The danger , as so often with the old boy , is n't if he 's insincere . 
1	90	 It 's if he really means what he said .Donald Trump discovers his inner neocon

1	95	Ever since last week 's High Court judgment threw a spanner in the works of the Government 's plan to use the Royal Prerogative to trigger Article 50 there have been all sorts of rumours and suggestions as to how the Government is going to deliver Brexit . 
1	95	 Theresa May has already said she will appeal to the Supreme Court . 
1	95	 Brexit Secretary David Davis confirmed this in the Commons on Monday . 
1	95	 Another suggestion is to bring forward a Bill that specifically rejects the High Court 's ruling and hands the Government the power to act alone . 
1	95	 Or there 's the idea of a simple one - line Bill to trigger Article 50 itself . 
1	95	 And those are just the more obvious ideas . 
1	95	 There seem to be as many different theories and suggestions as there are EU members . 
1	95	 The moment we trigger Article 50 the clock starts ticking and we know we will leave the EU 24 months later , deal or no deal . 
1	95	 Brexit will mean Brexit 
1	95	 Things would be so much better if , as in the joke , we did n't have to start from here . 
1	95	 Or , to put it another way , if Mrs May had done what her predecessor had suggested should happen . 
1	95	 Because for all his faults David Cameron got one thing bang on . 
1	95	" Back in February , when he was setting out to MPs the details of the pathetic "" deal "" he had negotiated with the EU , Mr Cameron made clear what he thought would and should happen if we voted for Brexit : "" If the British people vote to leave there is only one way to bring that about , namely to trigger Article 50 of the treaties and begin the process of exit and the British people would rightly expect that to start straightaway . "" "
1	95	 The referendum took place in June . 
1	95	 Theresa May 's plan is to trigger Article 50 by the end of March next year . 
1	95	 Even if she sticks to that timetable that will have been a nine - month wait . 
1	95	" By no stretch of the imagination can that be described as triggering Article 50 "" straightaway "" . "
1	95	 Mr Davis confirmed that Mrs May has already said she will appeal to the Supreme Court 
1	95	 But Mr Cameron was clearly right that the British people would expect the process to have started straightaway . 
1	95	 With hindsight it is surely now clear to everyone who is n't plotting to stop Brexit - and was clear after the referendum to many of us - that Mrs May should have done what Mr Cameron said would happen and triggered Article 50 as soon as she entered Downing Street . 
1	95	 Indeed he might even have done so himself . 
1	95	 Imagine how different things would now be . 
1	95	 Instead of politics being consumed with questions of procedure and timing - almost all of which are fig leaves pushed by Remainers who do n't want us to leave - and instead of the Remainers being handed ever more time to plot how they can frustrate the will of the British people , the path would have been set and the referendum result honoured . 
1	95	 Straightaway . 
1	95	 The moment we trigger Article 50 the clock starts ticking and we know we will leave the EU 24 months later , deal or no deal . 
1	95	 Brexit will mean Brexit . 
1	95	 Unless there is a unanimous decision by the rest of the EU to change that timetable nothing can alter that . 
1	95	 So that 's what should have happened . 
1	95	 But the fact that it did n't does n't mean there are n't important lessons for the future as to what should now happen and how we can avoid a further mess . 
1	95	 Mrs May repeated after the High Court ruling that she still plans to trigger Article 50 by the end of March . 
1	95	" The crucial word here is "" by "" . "
1	95	 That does n't necessarily mean waiting until March . 
1	95	 It means making sure it 's done by March , which could mean acting now . 
1	95	 And there are compelling reasons why she should put a stop to the uncertainty and trigger Article 50 now . 
1	95	 Most obviously it would destroy the Remainers ' attempts to keep us in . 
1	95	 They are playing for time . 
1	95	 They have been doing that since the vote and will continue doing so for as long as they can . 
1	95	 Their hope is that the longer they delay Article 50 being triggered , the more they can make a case that the referendum result is no longer valid . 
1	95	 Make no mistake about this : they will do whatever they can to stop Article 50 coming into force . 
1	95	 That 's just one reason why appealing to the Supreme Court carries a huge risk : that the Government might lose . 
1	95	 The Remainers who brought the case are using the language of parliamentary scrutiny because it sounds appropriate and modest . 
1	95	 But their goal is n't scrutiny : it 's destruction . 
1	95	 They want to destroy the referendum result . 
1	95	 And handing them any victory , especially from the Supreme Court , is unnecessary and unwise . 
1	95	 We d , September 14 , 2016 
1	95	 Britain has voted to leave the EU . 
1	95	 So who 's next ? 
1	95	 We look at which European countries want to hold their own EU referendum . 
1	95	 Frexit , Nexit or Auxit ? 
1	95	 Who will be next to leave the EU 
1	95	 On Monday the Brexit Secretary confirmed in the Commons that the Government could introduce a one - line Bill triggering Article 50 now , bypassing any Supreme Court decision . 
1	95	 The Remainers would then be put on the spot and their plots exposed . 
1	95	 Voting against triggering Article 50 would reveal their real agenda of ignoring the referendum result . 
1	95	 They would doubtless seek to amend the Bill and use every parliamentary device at their disposal . 
1	95	 But their motives would be obvious and the wiser among them would surely realise the huge risk they were running with democracy itself . 
1	95	 They would in reality have no choice but to accept the result of the referendum and implement Article 50 - or risk sticking two fingers up to the very idea of a sovereign people . 
1	95	 And even the Remainers , surely , are not that wilful .The Prime Minister should not wait to trigger Article 50 , writes Stephen Pollard
1	96	Former President Barack Obama waves as he departs the East Front of the U.S. Capitol , Friday , Jan. 20 , 2017 in Washington after the inauguration of President Donald Trump . ( 
1	96	 AP Photo / Alex Brandon ) 
1	96	" Dumbfounded that Donald Trump beat his hand - picked successor , Hillary Clinton , as president , former President Barack Obama and a top aide began plotting to "" destroy "" the president - elect around Christmas , according to a new book on Democrat efforts to undermine President Trump . "
1	96	 What 's more , the goal was to not just damage the Trump presidency but set the Republican president up for impeachment , according to Ed Klein 's latest from Regnery Publishing , All Out War : The Plot to Destroy Trump . 
1	96	 It goes on sale tomorrow . 
1	96	" In an exclusive excerpt provided to Secrets , Klein described a "" Christmastime "" dinner during which national security adviser Susan Rice pushed plans to "" unmask , or disclose , the names of several Trump campaign associates who were mentioned or whose conversations were captured in intelligence intercepts of Russian officials . "" "
1	96	 Klein , a former New York Times editor who has written several insider accounts critical of the Clintons and Obamas , said that Obama knew of Rice 's efforts to disclose the names in hopes they would leak to the media and spark an investigation . 
1	96	" "" He knew Rice wanted to encourage leaks to the Washington Post and the New York Times accusing Trump and his campaign of colluding with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the American presidential election , "" Klein wrote . "
1	96	" "" If Rice 's plot succeeded — that is , if it could be proved that Trump had colluded with Putin during the campaign or , later , if it could be proved that he had tried to prevent an investigation into such collusion — Trump would likely face charges of impeachment , "" said the new Klein book . "
1	96	 But , he added , Obama did n't know that his closest aide , Valerie Jarrett , was behind the plot . 
1	96	 Rice eventually had to testify to Congress about her actions , and denied leaking Trump campaign and associate names . 
1	96	" Klein does not reveal his source other than offering the source as Jarrett 's "" friend . "" "
1	96	" During the dinner , wrote Klein , first lady Michelle Obama raised concerns that the effort was clearly a political plot to "" sandbag "" Trump . "
1	96	 Rice , however , is quoted saying she was worried about national security and she referenced the leaks of Democratic National Committee emails , embarrassing to the Clinton campaign , by Russian sources . 
1	96	 She wanted , said the book , to make sure that the alleged links to the Trump campaign and Russia became public before Trump came to office . 
1	96	" "" She said she was afraid that once Trump got into the White House , the evidence of collusion would be covered up or destroyed , "" wrote Klein . "
1	96	" At that point during the dinner , the former first lady , said the book , cautioned that the plot could "" bite us in the ass . "" "
1	96	" As her husband mulled Rice 's plea to unmask the names by lowering security clearances , Jarrett 's "" friend "" told Klein , "" Most of the time he had to choose between the lesser of two evils . "
1	96	 This was an example of such a dilemma . 
1	96	 It was clearly unethical to use illegal leaks to sabotage Trump . 
1	96	" But Barack could argue that it was his patriotic to duty to draw attention to the possibility that the Trump campaign had conspired with the Russians to influence the outcome of an American election . "" "
1	96	" At point , his source said , "" Valerie piped up . ‘ "
1	96	 Well , ' she said , ‘ [ FBI Director James ] Comey thinks Susan 's on to something . 
1	96	 He 's investigating whether the Trump campaign cooperated with the Russians . 
1	96	" There must be something there . ' "" "
1	96	" Klein concluded , "" Valerie has a sixth sense how to handle Barack and Michelle . "
1	96	 She understood Michelle 's reservations and her desire to protect her husband , and she wanted to give Michelle a chance to vent . 
1	96	" But Valerie left no doubt that she was in favor of Barack going along with Susan 's scheme . "" "

0	97	President Trump has issued an order banning the ' Saturday Night Live ' television show . 
0	97	 In April 2017 , the St. George Gazette web site published an article positing that President Trump had signed an executive order forcing NBC 's popular and long - running Saturday Night Live sketch comedy TV program off the air : 
0	97	 Today President Donald Trump made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency by signing Executive Order 14838 , which cancels the television show Saturday Night Live , or SNL . 
0	97	 Under the new order , it is now illegal for any private or federally funded agency to air or show footage of the popular television show in any format . 
0	97	 Any company or individual who violates this order can now face fines of up to $ 250,000 and five years in federal prison . 
0	97	" During the press conference today , Trump explained that his decision was based on a personal belief that the show is "" divisive "" and "" contrary to America 's deepest held values . "" "
0	97	" "" Saturday Night Live is the definition of fake news and that is why it is now gone forever , "" Trump told reporters . "" "
0	97	 It mocks the very beliefs that keep this great country running smoothly . 
0	97	 I 've never found the show to be humorous and I do n't know how it stayed on the air as long as it did , but I made sure to put an end to that today . 
0	97	" I know some actions that I take are questioned by those who do n't want or understand freedom ; these are people who hate America , but I know my true supporters are with me on this decision to cancel SNL , just like all my other brilliant ideas . "" "
0	97	 Trump 's signing of Executive Order 14838 comes after more than two seasons of Saturday Night Live attacking the current President . 
0	97	 There was no truth to this story ( the premise of which would clearly constitute a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech ) .

0	98	" A lot of voters woke up this morning happy that Donald Trump had won the election , but the other half of them , especially here in California , were very upset , "" Kimmel noted . "" "
0	98	" People were shocked , despondent , some were even crying . "" "
0	98	 As a result , the late - night host decided to walk his viewers through the five stages of grief . 
0	98	" The first stage in the process is denial , which Kimmel summarized as "" no , the host of Celebrity Apprentice ca n't possibly be our president , CNN must have the math wrong . "" "
0	98	" After that comes the anger stage : "" Who do I blame for this ? "" "

1	99	We have made great strides in the policing of thought in this country . 
1	99	 Just ask Brendan Eich , one of the founders of Mozilla , developers of the web browser Firefox . 
1	99	 Eich had just landed a promotion to the big chair as Mozilla 's CEO . 
1	99	 He lasted all of nine days . 
1	99	 The reason ? 
1	99	 Back in 2008 Eich donated a thousand dollars to support Proposition 8 , the California ballot initiative to ban same - sex marriage . 
1	99	 The unearthing of this donation led to protests from gay rights activists and the h igh profile call for a boycott of Firefox by dating site OkCupid.com . 
1	99	" Eich , as many people in circumstances such as his , was stricken with the sudden desire to "" spend more time with his family "" and quietly resigned . "
1	99	 Regardless of your position on same sex marriage , those activists who led to Eich 's resignation should be ashamed . 
1	99	" Their basic message ? "" "
1	99	 You 'd better be tolerant . 
1	99	 Or else we will show you a display of true tolerance . 
1	99	" By crushing you . "" "
1	99	 In fact , it is no longer enough to be tolerant . 
1	99	" Prior to his resignation , Eich told tech site CNET "" [ i]f Mozilla can not continue to operate according to its principles of inclusiveness , where you can work on the mission no matter what your background or other beliefs , I think we 'll probably fail . "" "
1	99	" In the same interview , he said that he wished for those who were calling for his ouster to know that "" without getting into my personal beliefs , which I separate from my Mozilla work — when people learned of the donation , they felt pain . "
1	99	 I saw that in friends ' eyes , [ friends ] who are LGBT [ lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgendered ] . 
1	99	 I saw that in 2012 . 
1	99	" I am sorry for causing that pain . "" "
1	99	 Wow . 
1	99	 Eich sounds like an intolerant jerk ! 
1	99	 No , strike that . 
1	99	 He sounds like a dedicated and thoughtful professional who was able to separate his work and personal lives - as well he should have been . 
1	99	 But to the activist crowd , it 's not enough that people are tolerant . 
1	99	 They must offer affirmation of the LGBT agenda or pay the price . 
1	99	 Their much vaunted toleration does n't extend to those who might have opposing viewpoints , like Eich . 
1	99	 Of course , gay rights activists claim that Eich 's views are not deserving of toleration because he sought to strip them of their rights . 
1	99	 This may or may not be the case , but I 'd wager that many of them are n't such dogged defenders of rights when asked about , say , the Second Amendment . 
1	99	 And I 'm hearing curiously little from these champions of freedom about the fact that 70 percent of California 's African Americans and over 50 percent of Hispanics voted for Prop 8 . 
1	99	 The uncomfortable fact for the left is that 2008 was the same election in which minority voters pulled the levers in droves for President Obama . 
1	99	 Even more uncomfortable ? 
1	99	 President Obama himself was opposed to same sex marriage in 2008 . 
1	99	 But , then , it 's not about principle . 
1	99	" It 's about ramming through the "" right "" outcomes . "
1	99	" An Associated Press piece about Eich 's resignation asks "" whether the episode undercuts the well - groomed image of Silicon Valley as a marketplace of ideas and diversity of thought , and whether , in this case , the tech world surrendered to political correctness enforced through a public shaming on social media . "" "
1	99	 Geez , ya think ? 
1	99	 Andrew Sullivan , the unreliably conservative columnist had this to say : 
1	99	 Will [ Eich ] now be forced to walk through the streets in shame ? 
1	99	 Why not the stocks ? 
1	99	 The whole episode disgusts me - as it should disgust anyone interested in a tolerant and diverse society . 
1	99	 If this is the gay rights movement today - hounding our opponents with a fanaticism more like the religious right than anyone else - then count me out . 
1	99	 If we are about intimidating the free speech of others , we are no better than the anti - gay bullies who came before us . 
1	99	 The trite knock at the religious right is to be expected from a regular guest on Bill Maher 's show , but Sullivan is right to call the gay rights activists out on their bullying tactics . 
1	99	 And the man has skin in the game , as an openly gay man who has long supported same sex marriage . 
1	99	 Kudos to Sullivan for recognizing that support for an issue does n't require the squashing of all dissenting viewpoints . 
1	99	" Liberals like to mock those who speak of the "" gay agenda . "" "
1	99	 The real agenda , they claim , is for homosexuals to be able to live out their lives in dignity with their loved ones . 
1	99	 Such efforts at destroying opposition unfortunately make that more difficult to believe . 
1	99	 And activists forget that perhaps next time , they wo n't be the ones to define which thought crimes should be prosecuted . 
1	99	" In a society which encourages the personal destruction of dissenters , any one of us can develop the desire to "" spend more time with family "" at any time .Gay Activists : Be Tolerant . Or We Will Destroy You !"
1	100	( ThyBlackMan.com ) Even though I am black , I was raised on Superman 's ; truth , justice and the American way . 
1	100	 I always believed Americans were the world 's good guys . 
1	100	" As a kid , I watched my mom cry over "" I Love Lucy "" TV stars Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz getting a divorce . "
1	100	 I remember our entire family , mom , dad and five kids gathered around our single television ; nail - biting tension in the air as we nervously awaited the final out for our Baltimore Orioles to win the World 's Series over the Pittsburgh Pirates . 
1	100	 Despite our country 's racial issues , we patriotically embraced the distinct American culture . 
1	100	 We were Americans . 
1	100	" When President JFK said , "" Ask not what your country can do for you , ask what you can do for your country "" , I believe a majority of Americans agreed with him . "
1	100	" For years , I sang my song , "" Celebrate America "" http://bit.ly/2h0Swyv at Naturalization Oath of Allegiance Ceremonies . "
1	100	 I thought it was pretty cool that mine was the first song new Americans heard after taking their oath of allegiance . 
1	100	 I witnessed thousands of immigrants who jumped through all the hoops , learned our language and history and tearfully pledged their allegiance . 
1	100	 I still remember a gentleman who appeared to be in his 90s , raised to his feet from a wheelchair by a grandchild on each arm . 
1	100	 Their entire family wept as he took his oath . 
1	100	 Clearly , it meant something extremely special to become an American . 
1	100	 It pained me deeply watching Obama lower the bar , redefining and dumbing down what it means to be an American . 
1	100	 Obama rolled out the red carpet welcoming tens of thousands of illegals to invade our country for welfare benefits ; even benefits unavailable to American citizens . 
1	100	 http://washex.am/2eL6TGl For immigrants legally becoming new citizens , Obama made pledging to defend our county optional . 
1	100	 http://bit.ly/1MkmOmR 
1	100	 Assuming Hillary would win the WH , Obama figured his illegal invaders would eventually be gifted voting rights . 
1	100	 It did not matter to Obama that they had no desire to embrace our culture , respect our flag or learn to speak English . 
1	100	 In essence , Barack Obama took the majestic shine off of becoming an American . 
1	100	 The late queen of cosmetics , Mary Kay Ash said the speed of the leader is the speed of the gang . 
1	100	 Unarguably , Obama 's disdain and disrespect for Americanism trickled down infecting our country . 
1	100	" Public schools banned the singing of "" God Bless the USA / Proud to be an America "" . "
1	100	 http://bit.ly/2mFeyFG Students were barred from wearing t - shirts to school featuring the U.S. flag on Cinco De Mayo http://fxn.ws/2ojaNGY , claiming it was hateful and insensitive to illegal Mexican students . 
1	100	 Multimillionaire pro athletes refused to stand for our national anthem , proclaiming themselves victims of America . 
1	100	 Their example of dissing our flag trickled down to high and middle school athletes across America . 
1	100	 http://bbc.in/2uuuyAu 
1	100	 Under Barack Obama , JFK 's words inspiring Americans to strive for excellence for the good of their country were thrown on the junk - heap of forgotten history . 
1	100	 Obama 's new Americanism was about demonizing and punishing self - reliant achievers , pandering to lazy parasites and addicting as many Americans as possible to big government dependency . 
1	100	 Due to decades of our Leftist controlled public schools abandoning teaching U.S. history , far too many Americans quickly surrendered their precious God - given and fought for freedom and liberty for a free Obama phone and his promise to Robin Hood the rich . 
1	100	" Ben Franklin said , "" Those who would give up essential Liberty , to purchase a little temporary Safety , deserve neither Liberty nor Safety . "" "
1	100	 Barack Obama actually launched an ad campaign begging illegals to apply for food stamps . 
1	100	 http://dailym.ai/1PPPdR1 
1	100	 Using a Hispanic soap opera , Barack Obama told illegals that applying for as many U.S. government freebie programs as possible was the honorable thing to do for their families . 
1	100	 http://bit.ly/2tH14AA 
1	100	 It was also painful watching Barack Obama insidiously divide Americans into supposed victimized voting blocs ; blacks , Hispanics , women , transgenders and so on . 
1	100	 Suddenly , we became an entitlement - minded gimme - society ; everyone running around claiming America abused them and therefore owed them a living . 
1	100	 I kept thinking what the heck is going on . 
1	100	 We are better than this . 
1	100	" I wanted to scream from the roof tops , "" This is not who we are . "
1	100	" Darn it , we are AMERICANS ! ! ! "" "
1	100	" In my song , "" We Are Americans "" http://bit.ly/1AIVqp6 , I ask my fellow Americans to repent and return to our founding principles . "
1	100	 I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Mark Levin recently penned a book in which he brilliantly articulated the source of my heartache for my country ; the well - orchestrated cultural and moral decline of America . 
1	100	" Levin 's book is titled , "" Rediscovering Americanism And The Tyranny of Progressivism "" http://amzn.to/2udTux9 "
1	100	 The good news is Donald Trump winning the WH in an electoral landslide proves that despite decades of Leftists trying to convince Americans that we are the greatest source of evil in the world , the masses still love our country and long to see her made great again . 
1	100	 And for that , I am extremely hopeful and grateful . 
1	100	 Prayerfully , Trump will usher in us becoming Americans again .

1	101	"When the discussion of gun control rears its ugly head , some well - meaning proponent of "" common sense gun measures "" invariably tells us that no one wants to take our guns . "
1	101	" They swear that they only want the "" bad "" guns . "
1	101	" Maybe they 'll say , "" No one needs an assault rifle "" but if you mention bans on bolt action guns or handguns , they start backing up with their hands in supplication . "" "
1	101	 No , no , no , no . 
1	101	" No one wants to do anything about those , "" he 'll say . "
1	101	 That means he 's either wrong or lying . 
1	101	 Democratic politicians have been brainwashed by political hacks like me to begin all of their statements about guns by declaring support for the Second Amendment and a deep affinity for the cultures of hunters and sportsmen — even if they themselves have never fired weapons . 
1	101	" We call them "" gun safety "" proposals instead of "" gun control "" measures because pollsters and consultants divined that "" gun safety "" would be less alarming to gun voters , and that gun voters were to be coddled at all cost . "
1	101	 The Democratic gun control strategy fails because it is defined by this poverty of ambition — the determination never to look beyond fear of political repercussions . 
1	101	 Universal background checks and a ban on high - capacity magazines are good ideas and we should seize the opportunity to enact them if it presents itself . 
1	101	 But they wo n't come anywhere close to making gun violence in America a tolerable problem . 
1	101	 We are nibbling around the edges instead of proposing bold , meaningful solutions such as : 
1	101	 A national gun registry , so law - enforcement officials can know when someone is compiling an arsenal . 
1	101	 The government can track purchases of allergy medicines that can be used to make methamphetamine , and fertilizers that can be used to make bombs , like the one used in Oklahoma City in 1994 , but not deadly assault weapons . 
1	101	 That 's absurd . 
1	101	 Tracking and limiting purchases of ammunition . 
1	101	 Requiring that guns use smart - gun technology , which would dramatically reduce accidental deaths , particularly among children , who , according to a 2016 study , are dying accidental deaths at the hands of guns at the rate of one every other day . 
1	101	 A national gun buyback program similar to the one Australia instituted after a mass shooting that killed 35 people . 
1	101	 That incident was in 1996 . 
1	101	 There has n't been another one since , 
1	101	 These proposals are essentially omitted from the national conversation largely because Democrats are scared that the NRA will spin them disingenuously to inflame gun owners . 
1	101	 Again , Democrats presume their hand is the weaker of the two . 
1	101	" Last week , Republicans rejoiced , and some Democrats winced privately , when Nancy Pelosi said she hoped regulation of bump stocks — the device the Las Vegas shooter used to make his weapon more deadly — would be a "" slippery slope "" to further regulation . "
1	101	 Democrats were concerned that Pelosi had handed the NRA a political cudgel the group would brandish against every one of them . 
1	101	 But Pelosi was right , and I would like to see more Democrats find her courage , because the alternative is to surrender our ideals , and the moral high ground , for no discernible upside . 
1	101	 Written by former Obama staffer Dan Pfeiffer who seems absolutely in love with gun control . 
1	101	 After all , he calls for a national gun buyback program similar to Australia 's but fails to inform his readers that the buyback was simply a more palatable gun confiscation program masquerading as choice . 
1	101	" Then again , this is the guy who says this , followed by claiming , "" Republicans currently control every branch of government and the NRA is still producing agitprop aimed at convincing gun owners that liberal Democrats and radical leftists are going to come after their guns . "" "
1	101	 He says this without a hint of irony at the fact that he is telling Democrats to come after our guns . 
1	101	 The entire post is nothing more than a paper dedicated to trying to convince Democrats that the answer to guns is to move even more to the left on guns , to stop pretending that they do n't want all the guns , yet he has the nerve to blame the NRA for producing videos ? 
1	101	 It should be noted that the video he chose is the one where Dana Loesch calls out the leftist media for lying . 
1	101	 It actually does n't say a thing about how Democrats want all the guns . 
1	101	 Not that it matters to someone like Pfeiffer . 
1	101	 All that matters is that Democrats are n't being honest about coming after all of our guns . 
1	101	 He 's annoyed they wo n't be honest , but I 'm going to let Dan know something . 
1	101	 We already know they want them all , and that 's why no one is backing down . 
1	101	 Especially since none of his proposals would have stopped Las Vegas .Anti - Gun Crusader Admits What We Already Knew

0	103	" US President Donald Trump on Thursday dismissed an upcoming book on his campaign and administration as "" full of lies "" and invented sources , after unsuccessfully attempting to block its release . "
0	103	" "" I authorised Zero access to White House ( actually turned him down many times ) for author of phony book ! "
0	103	 I never spoke to him for book . 
0	103	" Full of lies , misrepresentations and sources that do n't exist , "" Mr. Trump tweeted in reference to Michael Wolff 's "" Fire and Fury : Inside the Trump White House . "" "
0	103	" "" Look at this guy 's past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve ! "" "
0	103	 Mr. Trump wrote . 
0	103	 It was unclear to whom Mr. Trump was referring , with possibilities including Steve Bannon , his former chief strategist , and Steve Rubin , the president of Henry Holt and Company , which is publishing Wolff 's book . 
0	103	 The book quotes key Mr. Trump aides , including Mr. Bannon , expressing serious doubt about his fitness for office . 
0	103	 Mr. Trump has been enraged by the betrayal by Mr. Bannon — a man who engineered the New York real estate mogul 's link to the nationalist far right and helped create a pro - Trump media ecosystem . 
0	103	 After Mr. Trump instructed his lawyers to try to block the release of the book , the publishers responded by moving the release date up by four days to Friday .Trump says new book on his administration ‘ full of lies '
1	104	Methinks she doth protest too much -- and too late . 
1	104	 Those who condemned President Trump for not condemning white supremacist groups quickly and forcefully enough after Charlottesville have no problem with Hillary Clinton taking five full days to hypocritically condemn sexual predator Harvey Weinstein . 
1	104	 Maybe she was pondering the similarities between Weinstein 's predatory activities and that of her husband . 
1	104	 Both used their positions of power to extort sexual favors , sometimes forcibly , from women . 
1	104	 And just as Hollywood looked the other way for the sake of career advancement so too did Hillary Clinton as she rode her husband 's attained coattails to political prominence . 
1	104	 So her recent expression of disgust over Weinstein 's activities ring hollow : 
1	104	 At long last , the people who do the strategic planning for Hillary Clinton and tell her what emotions she should imitate in response to various stimuli have weighed in and they have decided that Harvey Weinstein is not a nice man : 
1	104	" "" I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein . "
1	104	 The behavior described by the women coming forward can not be tolerated . 
1	104	" Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior ... "" "
1	104	 Hillary Clinton knew who and what Weinstein was as surely as she knew and knows what Bill Clinton is . 
1	104	 Weinstein has been joined at the hip with the Clintons for a couple of decades … 
1	104	 Ironically , as it turns out , he was a major defender of Bill Clinton in the Lewinski affair though Weinstein seemed to favor aiming at the ficus bushes rather than blue dresses . 
1	104	 At the same time , mind you , that Hillary Clinton was active in directing a campaign to paint the battalion of women who had been sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton as morally decrepit if not outright crazy . 
1	104	 Between Hillary 's campaigns and the Clinton Foundation ( out of curiosity , is the FBI still investigating this ? ) 
1	104	 she has benefited from as much as a quarter million dollars from Weinstein . 
1	104	 Hollywood was a major funder of both the Clinton and Obama political machines , and many a Hollywood star defended Bill Clinton 's sordid activities as a personal matter as long as he was doing a good job as President . 
1	104	" They similarly defended Weinstein as Michelle Obama once did , as a "" wonderful human being "" , as well as "" a good friend and just a powerhouse "" Both the Obamas and Clintons knew Weinstein well and neither should be given a pass for feigning ignorance and shock at his activities : "
1	104	" None other than CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on Tuesday evening that former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama should not get a "" pass "" on Harvey Weinstein . "
1	104	" In fact , Toobin said their association with Weinstein throughout the years is a "" dark mark on their record . "" "
1	104	" "" I do n't think we can give the Clintons and the Obamas a pass here , "" Toobin said on Anderson Cooper 360 . "
1	104	" He cited Seth MacFarlane 's creepy joke about Weinstein at an Oscars event and added that MacFarlane 's joke illustrated that "" a lot of people knew or had very strong suspicions that this was a very bad guy . "" "
1	104	" "" The Obamas and the Clintons embraced him , did fundraisers with him , paid tribute to him , "" Toobin continued . "" "
1	104	" I think it 's a dark mark on their record … "" "
1	104	" The Obamas also finally said on record that they were "" disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein . "" "
1	104	" "" Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein , "" the Obamas said in a statement . "" "
1	104	 Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable , regardless of wealth or status . 
1	104	 We should celebrate the courage of women who have come forward to tell these painful stories . 
1	104	" And we all need to build a culture -- including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect -- so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future … "" "
1	104	" As Breitbart News has reported , Weinstein visited the Obama White House on at least 13 occasions and Obama 's daughter , Malia Obama , "" recently wrapped up an internship at the New York City offices of The Weinstein Co. "" "
1	104	 Right . 
1	104	 Perhaps Weinstein wanted to see where Bill Clinton dropped his cigar in the Oval Office . 
1	104	 Hillary , of course , should be all too familiar with Harvey Weinstein 's despicable behavior . 
1	104	 She watched her husband do the same and worse for decades as she also allegedly fought for women 's rights , except for the right of their victims to leave the room unmolested . 
1	104	 Hillary famously said that all claims of rape , abuse , and harassment should be deemed credible and be believed until proven otherwise . 
1	104	 It seems there was an exception for her husband , an exception required by her need to ride his coattails to power , just as Hollywood excused Weinstein because he could advance or kill the careers of those he exploited . 
1	104	 Gennifer Flowers , Monica Lewinsky , Paula Jones , Kathleen Willey as well as , some would suggest , a cast of thousands , have been groped , fondled , and used as sexual objects by one William Jefferson Clinton . 
1	104	" Was Hillary appalled and shocked at her husband 's predatory activities or did she blame it on that "" vast right - wing conspiracy "" ? "
1	104	 And then there 's Juanita Broaddrick , who has accused President Clinton of rape . 
1	104	" Juanita Broaddrick 's story is a credible one , and one of the many "" bimbo eruptions "" that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton handled during her husband Bill 's presidential campaign As Linda Tripp , confidante of former Clinton intern Monica Lewinsky , told the Daily Mail of how Hillary both enabled and covered up Bill 's many dalliances : "
1	104	 Tripp said : ' His political success was largely dependent upon Hillary . 
1	104	 He owed her a great deal . 
1	104	 As is widely acknowledged , Hillary took care of all the ' bimbo eruptions ' of which there were thousands in order to present to the world an electable candidate . 
1	104	 ' In this endeavor she was ruthless . 
1	104	 She destroyed women so that their stories never saw the light of day . ' 
1	104	 So much for fighting for women 's rights . 
1	104	" At a Trump press conference in 2016 , Broaddrick , tired of being accused of being part of that vast right - wing conspiracy , and afraid that her attacker would once again occupy the White House with the woman who orchestrated the attacks on Bill Clinton 's "" bimbo eruptions "" , repeated her accusation : "
1	104	" "" Actions speak louder than words , "" Broaddrick said . "" "
1	104	 Mr. Trump may have said some bad words but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me . 
1	104	" I do n't think there 's any comparison . "" "
1	104	 Broaddrick , who has said Hillary threatened her , appeared with fellow Clinton sexual assault victims Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey appeared in an interview at presidential suite of the historic Watergate and related the taleof Bill 's assaults and their fear of Hillary 's retaliation : 
1	104	 In an exclusive video interview at the presidential suite of the historic Watergate Hotel , the victims of Bill Clinton 's alleged sexual assault -- Juanita Broaddrick , Kathleen Willey , and Paula Jones -- got together for the first time in person to express their personal fear of Hillary Clinton and to warn voters that Clinton does not stand for women 's issues .. 
1	104	" The three women , who say their lives were forever changed by their experiences with the Clintons , used words like "" terrified "" and "" frightened "" to describe their feelings about the prospects of a Hillary Clinton presidency … "
1	104	" "" We were not willing participants , "" Broaddrick said . "" "
1	104	" These were crimes . "" "
1	104	 In a separate interview , Broaddrick shared her own story of brutal sexual assault which she says Bill Clinton perpetrated against her . 
1	104	" Willey called out NBC News ' Andrea Mitchell and CNN 's Jake Tapper by name , challenging them : "" These are not infidelities . "
1	104	 A rape is not an infidelity . 
1	104	 These are crimes . 
1	104	 Any other people would be in jail … 
1	104	" "" This is no longer about infidelities , indiscretions , girlfriends , sex , interns -- none of those . "

1	107	 It should have been obvious from the despicable things he said about Mexican immigrants . 
1	107	 It should have been clear from his anti - Muslim rants . 
1	107	 It seeped through in his reaction to the deadly march in Charlottesville , Va. , putting white supremacists on the same level as civil rights demonstrators . 
1	107	 And now it 's emerging again in the debate over Dreamers and Salvadorans who have been protected from deportation . 
1	107	" Trump says he wants an $ 18 billion wall on the border with Mexico , and an end to the visa lottery and "" chain migration . "" "
1	107	 His entire immigration policy seems to have the goalof reducing immigration from non - white countries and somehow boosting immigration from Europe . 
1	107	 Trump says he wants to put America First in all matters . 
1	107	 But this is n't the America that many of us cherish - the nation of immigrants , of the Statue of Liberty . 
1	107	 Advocacy groups for immigrants condemned what Trump reportedly said , and Democrats plan to introduce a censure resolutionnext week . 
1	107	" Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana , chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , tweeted that the president 's comments "" are further proof that his Make America Great Again agenda is really a Make America White Again agenda . "" "
1	107	 The White House issued a statementthat did n't deny his slur , but defended his stand on immigration . 
1	107	 Early Friday , Trump , who never apologizes for anything , offered a denial in a series of tweets , though it 's difficult to take him at his word given his track record of lies . 
1	107	" "" The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough , but this was not the language used , "" the president tweeted . "" "
1	107	" What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA ! "" "

1	107	" Reading prepared remarks , he called the civil rights icon a "" great American hero "" who preached racial equality . "
1	107	 He refused to answer questions about the uproar , including whether he was racist . 
1	107	 To say the scene was jarring does n't begin to capture how bizarre it was . 
1	107	 This is beyond the daily drama and craziness coming out of this White House , and is already hurting the nation 's standing around the globe . 
1	107	" Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said Trump 's "" vile comments "" only "" make the jobs of Americans stationed all over the world harder - soldiers , diplomats and businesses . "" "
1	107	" "" We all need to stop pretending that there are no consequences when the most powerful person in the world espouses racist views and gives a wink and a nod to the darkest elements in our society , "" Feinstein said in perhaps her toughest statement yet on Trump . "" "

1	109	Republicans knew what they were getting when they overwhelmingly voted for Bruce Rauner . 
1	109	 He made no secret of his support for abortion . 
1	109	 In 2014 , his wife , Diana Rauner , went so far as to take out an ad assuring pro - choice Democrats of her husband 's stance . 
1	109	 Despite what you 've been reading about the far right 's consternation with Bruce Rauner over his ostensible support for abortion in Illinois , I think it 's been a pretty good month for the governor . 
1	109	 The union - busting Janus v. American Federation of State , County , and Municipal Employees case that he initiated has made it to the Supreme Court . 
1	109	 And he 's got liberal groups like Planned Parenthood praising him for his stance on reproductive rights . 
1	109	 It looks like he may be able to put together the band of rabid right - wingers and abortion - rights moderates who helped elect him in the first place . 
1	109	 I know that sounds like the oddest of coalitions — but it just goes to show you what a clever politician can buy with his billions . 
1	109	" The Republican right - to - lifers are furious that Rauner flip - flopped and signed HB 40 , the reproductive rights bill that expanded Medicaid funding for some abortions and eliminated the controversial "" trigger provision "" from state law . ( "
1	109	 The trigger language would 've made abortions illegal in Illinois should Roe v. Wade be overturned . ) 
1	109	 And many , including Steve Bannon , are talking about recruiting someone to mount a primary challenge against Rauner . 
1	109	 But I think it 's mostly bluster . 
1	109	 In fact , I ca n't understand why they 're so outraged . 
1	109	 They knew what they were getting when they overwhelmingly voted for Rauner back in 2014 . 
1	109	 Rauner made no secret of his support for abortion . 
1	109	 In 2014 , his wife , Diana Rauner , went so far as to take out an ad assuring pro - choice Democrats that when it came to abortion rights her husband would be no different than his opponent , former governor Pat Quinn . 
1	109	 Backed by many pro - choice moderates in DuPage County , the North Shore , and the Gold Coast , Rauner edged out Quinn and promptly went to work bankrupting public education by vetoing the budget . 
1	109	 Earlier this year , the governor panicked when it looked as though he might be losing support among downstate Republicans . 
1	109	 So he assured right - to - life legislators he would veto HB40 . 
1	109	 That enraged pro - choice voters , who claimed he was betraying his lifelong commitment to their cause . 
1	109	 Rauner found himself in a jam . 
1	109	 He had to decide which group he could least afford to alienate on the eve of next year 's election : Gold Coast and North Shore moderates or rabid Republicans . 
1	109	 Obviously , he went with the former , at least partly because , if push came to shove , they might actually vote for a Democrat . 
1	109	 As for the rabid right , he probably figured he 'd give 'em a tax break and they 'd follow him off a cliff . 
1	109	 Of course , Rauner was slick about it . 
1	109	 Over the summer he made a real show of inviting various pro - choice women to his office to explain to him how important it was to pass HB40 . 
1	109	 And then on September 28 , he signed it , making a big deal about it , like he was King Solomon making a wrenching decision as opposed to a lifelong abortion supporter doing what he 'd promised to do four years ago . 
1	109	 In any case , it seems to have worked . 
1	109	 Key players in the pro - choice movement fell for it . 
1	109	" When Rauner signed HB40 , Planned Parenthood of Illinois sent an e - mail calling on members to "" thank Governor Rauner . "" "
1	109	 Puh - lease ! 
1	109	" A more accurate response would 've been "" Thanks for nothing , Bruce ! "" "
1	109	 Even if the strategy fails and he does n't win reelection , Rauner 's in a perfect position to achieve his great dream of damaging , if not destroying , public unions in Illinois thanks to the Janus case . 
1	109	" Mark Janus is a state employee who argues that his First Amendment rights are being violated because state law requires him to contribute a "" fair share "" portion of his paycheck to the union that represents him — in this case , the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees . "
1	109	 In particular , he does n't think he should have to donate money to a union with which he disagrees politically . 
1	109	 It 's called a fair - share contribution because the money guarantees that workers share the cost of financing a union that represents them in bargaining and grievance hearings . 
1	109	 On February 9 , 2015 , a few weeks after he took office , Rauner issued an executive order halting automatic fair - share deductions from paychecks . 
1	109	 Several unions and attorney general Lisa Madigan sued and Rauner 's executive order was overturned . 
1	109	 Rauner also filed a suit in federal court seeking to stop automatic fair - share contributions on First Amendment grounds . 
1	109	 In 2016 , a federal judge ruled against Rauner , decreeing that the governor did n't have standing in the case . 
1	109	 By then Janus had joined the case — as a state employee , he clearly has standing . 
1	109	 Janus is being represented by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation , a union - busting outfit that 's financially supported by the Koch brothers , the Walton Family Foundation , and other stalwarts of the far right . 
1	109	 On September 28 , the Supreme Court agreed to hear Janus 's case . 
1	109	 The suit is similar to one filed by Rebecca Friedrichs , a teacher in California , who lost when the Supreme Court was deadlocked 4 - 4 . 
1	109	 Since then President Trump and the Senate have put conservative Neil Gorsuch on the court . 
1	109	 So unless another judge flips — c'mon Justice Kennedy , you can do it!—it looks like SCOTUS will issue a bruising blow against unions , which will have to scramble to keep up their funding . 
1	109	 This is a cruel irony on many levels . 
1	109	 For one thing , government employees such as Janus will be relatively defenseless without unions if they 're fired or harassed by a powerful politician like Rauner . 
1	109	 Good luck getting the National Right to Work Foundation to help them with that . 
1	109	 As for Rauner 's friends at Planned Parenthood — well , with a drop in membership , unions will be less able to help elect Democrats . 
1	109	 So really the assault on unions is an attempt to cripple the Democratic Party . 
1	109	 You do n't think the Koch brothers actually give a hoot about workers like Mark Janus , do you ? 
1	109	 If Democrats ca n't beat Republicans , they ca n't enact liberal - minded measures , like — oh , just to pick one — reproductive rights . 
1	109	 Think about this , Planned Parenthood .

0	112	 For example , an image was posted on Twitter in August 2017 by political commentator Dinesh D'Souza along with a message labeling Soros a Nazi collaborator : 
0	112	 The original photograph was taken at a campaign rally on 28 January 2008 at American University and showed then - candidate Barack Obama with Senator Ted Kennedy . 
0	112	 At some point , Soros 's head was superimposed over Kennedy 's to make it appear as if Obama was conspiring with the billionaire , who has become a boogeyman to some segments of the American right wing .

0	112	 The photograph was poorly digitally manipulated , and does not actually show Obama with Soros . 
0	112	 The first clue is the lighting : the shadows on Obama 's face ( for example , beneath his earlobe ) do not match the shadows on Soros 's face .

1	114	 Putting aside Trump 's inaccurate assessment of the quality of medical care prisoners receive and the woefully underfunded public defender system in the U.S. , Trump is attacking some of the bedrock principles of American justice . 
1	114	 Ever since Gideon v. Wainwright , the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution has been understood to require that everyone charged with serious offenses in this country receive defense counsel . 
1	114	 This protection for criminal defendants is cause for celebration , not castigation . 
1	114	" Speaking about this right in glowing terms , the Supreme Court has said it is "" necessary to insure fundamental human rights of life and liberty "" and called this a "" noble ideal "" without which there can be no fair trial . "
1	114	" Similarly , the Eighth Amendment prohibits "" cruel and unusual punishment . "" "
1	114	 We already know from Trump 's advocating extreme forms of torture that he is no fan of this part of the Constitution , but his comments Monday make that even clearer . 
1	114	" Prisoners ' serious medical needs can not be ignored ; doing so would be "" cruel and unusual . "" "
1	114	" The Supreme Court has explained that "" infliction of such unnecessary suffering is inconsistent with contemporary standards of decency "" and outlined the basic principle that "" the public be required to care for the prisoner , who can not , by reason of the deprivation of his liberty , care for himself . "" "
1	114	 Just this weekend , he once again showed that he could n't care less about the First Amendment . 
1	114	" After The New York Times published a story finding that Trump relied on $ 885 million in tax breaks to build his real estate empire in New York City , Trump tweeted , "" My lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent . "
1	114	 I said no ( for now ) , but they are watching . 
1	114	" Really disgusting . "" "
1	114	 Of course , as any middle school student will tell you , the First Amendment protects the freedom of the press . 
1	114	 Part of that protection is that no public figure can sue as a result of a bad story without proving malice , meaning that the journalists knew the story was false or demonstrated complete disregard for whether it was true . 
1	114	 This standard is crucial in protecting the press from being attacked by people who do n't like unflattering coverage . 
1	114	 Without this principle , the press would be too scared to write pieces critical of the powerful , and the First Amendment would be virtually meaningless . 
1	114	" It 's been clear from other contexts , though , that "" virtually meaningless "" is how Trump views the First Amendment as a whole . "
1	114	 Among other things , he has called for violence against individuals expressing their opinions and advocated for a religious test for those entering the country . 
1	114	 These positions fly in the face of the First Amendment 's protection of free expression and freedom of religion , as well as its guarantee against an established state religion . 
1	114	 Trump is no fan of the rest of the Constitution either . 
1	114	 His recently announced maternity leave plan includes no coverage for fathers , which shows his lack of concern for the 14th Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause ; his insistence that women and doctors should be punished for abortion shows that he does n't believe in a constitutional right to privacy under the Due Process Clause ; he has promised to violate treaties , which are constitutionally recognized sources of law ; he does n't understand the difference between state and federal authority , the basic principle of federalism which underlies the Constitution ; nor does he care about separation of powers , the founding constitutional idea that the president , Congress and the courts have different responsibilities in order to prevent tyranny . 
1	114	 In other words , other than his repeated invocation of the Second Amendment , including his not - so - oblique references to one of his supporters shooting Hillary Clinton ( something that came up again this weekend ) , Trump has shown that he disagrees not just with one or two isolated parts of the Constitution - which would be within normal democratic bounds , and is countenanced by the Constitution 's amendment process - but rather with the very fabric of the document . 
1	114	 This is highly unusual in American politics , where most debate occurs against the backdrop of accepted constitutional principles . 
1	114	 Trump does n't appear to accept those principles at all , and instead seems to want to be president of a country with a foreign understanding of government and its relationship to the people . 
1	114	" If Trump were elected , he would have to swear the same allegiance to the Constitution that every president has before him : "" I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . "" "
1	114	 Based on how he has campaigned over the past year , if he were to utter those last 10 words , he would be lying - as has become par for the course with Donald Trump .Donald Trump Does n't Believe in the Constitution

1	117	Trump had just married Melania when the recording was made in 2005 
1	117	" A couple of weeks ago , after the row over Trump "" fat - shaming "" Alicia Machado , I suggested the Republican candidate lay off our weight . "
1	117	 Warning : This article contains some graphic language 
1	117	 Now , and I can hardly believe I 'm having to write this , I suggest he lay off our vaginas . 
1	117	" The day after a video tape emerged in which he suggested he could have any woman he wants because he 's a star and so could just "" grab them by the pussy "" , Mr Trump is in a whole ocean of hot political water . "
1	117	 Enough , quite possibly , to sink any chance he had of winning the White House . 
1	117	 Why this tape - and not the myriad other controversies that have dogged him in recent weeks ? 
1	117	 First , analyse what he actually says . 
1	117	 There is something particularly sexist , I 'd say abusive , about this recording . 
1	117	 Read this excerpt : 
1	117	" "" When you 're a star , they let you do it . "
1	117	" You can do anything . "" "
1	117	" "" Whatever you want , "" the interviewer says . "
1	117	" "" Grab 'em by the pussy , you can do anything , "" Trump replies . "" "
1	117	 It 's the way Mr Trump reveals that he sees women as a piece of sexual meat , something he wants , grabs , discards that is so damning . 
1	117	 Lay off a woman 's size , Trump Is the Trump campaign done for ? 
1	117	 Could Republicans still dump Trump ? 
1	117	 The role of gender in the debate 
1	117	 Surveys ( US government and UN ) suggest one in five American women are the victim of rape or attempted rape and a staggering 83 % of girls suffer sexual harassment at school . 
1	117	 Mr Trump is not guilty of either of those but his language is exactly the kind of language that encourages men and boys to feel it 's okay to abuse women . 
1	117	" There is a violence in the phrases "" grab 'em by the pussy "" and "" you can do anything "" that any victim of abuse would recognise and that most women would find sickening . "
1	117	" To dismiss the tape as mere "" locker room banter "" and imply that the people who are offended are making an unnecessary fuss , or to say , as he did in his bizarre overnight apology tape , that this is just a distraction , compounds his problem . "
1	117	 Trump has offended many groups of people before 
1	117	 But this tape does n't just offend women , judging from the reaction in the Republican party - it has offended a lot of men too . 
1	117	 Whether those men will now withdraw their endorsements of him is yet to be seen . 
1	117	 Mr Trump has denigrated people before . 
1	117	 His comments about Muslims and Mexicans have arguably been equally grotesque and many , including some Republicans , have suggested they disqualified him for the presidency too . 
1	117	 Not everyone in America , however , knows a Muslim or a Mexican . 
1	117	 Most people , and most voters , do have wives , mothers , sisters or daughters and that 's why this tape touches a nerve , with both sexes , in a way his previous remarks have n't . 
1	117	 Powerful men using their position to get sex is nothing new , even in the White House . 
1	117	 JFK and Bill Clinton paved that path . 
1	117	 Today some of Trump 's supporters are making the case that anyone who voted for Bill Clinton has no right to be offended by Donald Trump . 
1	117	 Will the subject of Bill Clinton 's infidelities now come up at Sunday 's debate ? 
1	117	 I 've been critical of Mr Clinton 's treatment of women , and of Mrs Clinton 's role in shielding him , but those supporters are missing the point . 
1	117	 In 2016 , do n't we all want more from our leaders than another man who feels getting sex from whoever they want , whenever they want is simply one of the perks of power ? 
1	117	 For my two daughters , I know I do . 
1	117	 How Mr Trump manages the fallout from this is n't clear . 
1	117	 He does n't like apologising . 
1	117	 Indeed , he has bragged about never doing so . 
1	117	" Yet overnight he did release a video statement in which he said : "" I said it , I was wrong , and I apologise . "" "
1	117	 In the tape he then goes on to attack both Clintons ' records . 
1	117	 So on Sunday night , when he debates with Hillary Clinton for the second time , will he raise the issue of Bill Clinton 's affairs and Hillary 's role in discrediting the women involved , or will he keep quiet about sex altogether ? 
1	117	 In the past Mr Trump has not been able to resist lashing out when he 's under attack . 
1	117	 So , whatever his advisers may caution , I suspect we will see more of that in St Louis on Sunday night .Why this Trump row is different
1	118	By : Rachel Blevins/ The Free Thought Project President Trump issued his first official pardon on Friday , sparing former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio , who was found guilty of criminal contempt after he violated a court order in a racial profiling case by continuing to target illegal immigrants . 
1	118	" While both Trump and many of his supporters have applauded Arpaio , who refers to himself as "" America 's toughest sheriff , "" there is one thing he is not always tough on — pedophiles . "
1	118	" In fact , according to a report from the Associated Press in December 2011 , Airpaio 's office failed to investigate""more than 400 sex - crimes "" that were reported in Maricopa County from 2005 to 2007 , "" including dozens of alleged child molestations — that were inadequately investigated and in some instances were not worked at all . "" "
1	118	 The report cited current and former police officers familiar with the cases who claimed that victims of the horrific crimes were as young as 2 years old . 
1	118	" In El Mirage , the city where Arpaio 's office was providing contract police services , officials reportedly discovered at least 32 reported child molestations , and even though suspects were known in all but six cases , Arpaio "" failed to follow through . "" "
1	118	 While Arpaio made headlines for his infamous Tent City Jail , a camp in which nearly 1,000 illegal immigrants were forced to live outdoors in Arizona 's sweltering 120-degree heat , he did not make headlines for his treatment of the children of illegal immigrants . 
1	118	 According to the officers who worked with him , many of those children were victims of sex crimes , which Arpaio ignored , as he let their American citizen predators run free . 
1	118	" After Arpaio 's contract ended , and his office was no longer required to provide police services for El Mirage , Detective Jerry Laird told the AP he found that an overwhelming majority of the cases he received from the office had n't been worked , which meant that "" there were no follow - up reports , no collection of additional forensic evidence and zero effort made after the initial report of the crime was taken . "" "
1	118	" While some of the cases Arpaio 's office neglected were turned over to prosecutors , the report noted that the El Mirage Police Department claimed "" most were no longer viable — evidence dating as far back as 2006 had grown cold or was n't collected in the first place , victims had either moved away or otherwise moved on . "" "
1	118	" Arpaio held a news conference in response to the 2011 report , in which he said , "" If there were any victims , I apologize to those victims . "" "
1	118	 As The Free Thought Project has reported , a number of cases involving pedophiles have come to light under the Trump Administration , such as a pedophile ring investigation that resulted over 900 arrests in May , and a sex - trafficking investigation that resulted in over 1,000 arrests earlier this month . 
1	118	 This raises the question — why are n't Arpaio and other members of his office being held to the same standards ? 
1	118	 Joe Arpaio 's harsh treatment towards illegal immigrants has stirred up controversy , but his outright neglect of children who are victims of sex crimes seems to have slipped under the radar . 
1	118	 Children have no control over which country they are born in , and they are the most vulnerable to predators . 
1	118	" If a child is a victim of a sex crime , the question of whether the predators are "" illegal aliens "" or "" legal American citizens "" should not keep officials like Sheriff Arpaio from holding them accountable for their actions , and he should be held accountable for his failure to do so .Sheriff Who Trump Pardoned Protected Pedophiles By Refusing To Investigate Hundreds Of Child Sex Crimes"
1	119	The level of doublethink involved in being a contemporary member of the GOP is astounding . 
1	119	 Former Presidential candidate and current Donald Trump sycophant Mike Huckabee can barely even remember basic facts , like whether or not Trump has ever admitted to committing sexual assault . 
1	119	 The things Republicans have to tell themselves and the public in order to continue pushing their agenda take some serious mental gymnastics . 
1	119	" We have Presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway coining the term "" alternative facts . "" "
1	119	 Former Press Secretary Sean Spicer became a laughing stock for his outrageous defenses of President Donald Trump 's statements and behavior . 
1	119	 And the person who took Spicer 's Job , Sarah Huckabee Sanders , has continued that trend . 
1	119	 For example , she suggested that ESPN analyst Jemele Hill be fired for bullying President Trump on Twitter , despite the fact that the President regularly uses his own Twitter account to shout down opponents and turn his followers against others . 
1	119	 However , Sarah 's father Mike Huckabee may take the cake with his comments on Fox & Friends this morning . 
1	119	 Conservatives have loved speaking about disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and his donations to Democratic causes and candidates , and Trump 's favorite morning team and Huckabee decided to tie it back to Hillary Clinton yet again . 
1	119	 Host Abby Huntsman started things off by addressing Huckabee : 
1	119	" "" There was also an uncomfortable moment when she talked about President Trump , how he admitted to being sexual assaulter . "
1	119	 She was asked about the Weinstein situation and she mentioned how her husband - Bill Clinton - what he did was in the past . 
1	119	 Anyone watching that , I think , was a little squirmy in their seat . 
1	119	 She even looks squirmy , talking about it . 
1	119	" Has President Trump ever admitted to being a sexual assaulter ? "" "
1	119	" Anyone with a halfway functioning brain would of course recall the infamous Access Hollywood tape where Trump bragged about grabbing women "" by the pussy "" because he was famous . "
1	119	 Huckabee , apparently , lacks that halfway functioning brain , responding : 
1	119	" "" I do n't recall that that has ever happened . "" "
1	119	 He then proceeds to turn the discussion back to Bill Clinton , who , if you recall , was President twenty years ago . 
1	119	 Fairly selective memory there , Mike . 
1	119	 So keep playing in your big boy trucks , Donald , and know that your sycophants are doing everything in their power to rewrite history .

0	120	"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that "" Trump could be the greatest president in history . "" "
0	120	" In a 14 December 2016 interview with CNN 's Don Lemon , Robert Kennedy , Jr. said that "" I think Trump can be any kind of president he wants . "
0	120	" I think he could be the greatest president in history if he wanted to . "" "
0	120	 Kennedy , who spoke these words prior to Donald Trump 's taking office , was speaking in general terms about his hope that Trump would become a great president , seeing optimism in the fact that Trump appeared at the time to be unbound by ideology . 
0	120	 On 14 December 2016 , President John F. Kennedy 's nephew , Robert F. Kennedy Jr , appeared on CNN Tonight with Don Lemon to discuss the appointment of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State ( a move Kennedy , an environmental activist , was strongly opposed to ) . 
0	120	 In an earlier segment on that night 's show , Lemon and his guests had drawn comparisons between the Trumps and the Kennedys , referencing remarks made by former Microsoft head Bill Gates a day earlier , with Lemon 's asking Kennedy Jr. how he felt about this comparison : 
0	120	 We 've discussed this on this show during the primary season , but Bill Gates has said today that Trump could be a new JFK . 
0	120	 Some people look how close the Trump family is and how connected the children are to the family business and any they could be like the Kennedys . [ … ] 
0	120	 How do you feel about that ? 
0	120	" Kennedy 's answer , essentially , was not that Donald Trump had already done and achieved things that would fairly rank him as the "" greatest President in history , "" but that the comparison of Trump to the Kennedy family could turn out to be fair , because Donald Trump "" is less bound by ideology than any president probably that we 've had this century . "" "
0	120	 His statement was one of optimism for the future and was not rooted in anything Donald Trump ( who had yet to assume office ) had actually done as President : 
0	120	 I think Trump , you know , because he does n't have obligations , he does n't owe anything to anybody , if he 's — I think if he cares about history and he understands that history is his principal audience , that he could be an extraordinary president . [ … ] 
0	120	 He said to Leonardo DiCaprio the other day that he wanted to be the next Teddy Roosevelt and he can easily do that he could — but I think it 's important to start by surrounding yourself with advisers who share that idealism and not people who are just working for the oil industry . 
0	120	 I think he can be any kind of president he wants . 
0	120	 I think he could be the greatest president in history if he wanted to . 
0	120	" Since that exchange , numerous pro - Trump websites have run with Kennedy 's statement that "" I think [ Trump ] could be the greatest president in history "" without offering the any of the context that led to up to it . "
0	120	" Numerous YouTube videos excerpt this brief segment , posted under the title "" Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Drops Bombshell : ‘ Trump Could Be Greatest President In History ! ' "" "
0	120	 Other sites have added their own slanted commentary to Kennedy 's remark , frequently suggesting the conversation happened more recently . 
0	120	" In a May 2017 post frequently reshared on Facebook , ConservativeFighters.com gleefully and rhetorically asked : "" Can you hear the sobs coming from liberal protesters when a left - wing icon like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. finally admits the truth ? "" "
0	120	 While Kennedy is certainly a Democrat , he has expressed willingness to work with Trump in the past , especially during the timeframe when the Don Lemon interview took place . 
0	120	" Trump allegedly offered Kennedy ( though Trump later disputed this ) the chance to head a controversial commission on "" vaccine safety "" that had been widely panned by the medical community back in January 2017 . "
0	120	 However , because Kennedy 's words , in full context , were not offered as complimentary of Trump 's actions as a president ( which he was n't at that point ) but as a general hopefulness for the future , we rate this claim as a mixture .

0	121	The hotel security guard wounded in the Las Vegas mass shooting has been arrested as an accomplice to that event . 
0	121	" Fake news web sites capitalized on the tragedy of the 1 October 2017 mass shooting event in Las Vegas by proffering various unfounded conspiracy theories as "" news , "" particularly those positing that a "" second shooter "" took part in the carnage in additional to the one who rained bullets onto a concert crowd from a room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel . "
0	121	 In particular , fake news sites focused on Jesus Campos , the Mandalay Bay security guard who reportedly went to investigate a door alarm on the 32nd floor and was wounded in the leg when the shooter fired an estimated 200 bullets through his hotel room door . 
0	121	 Those sites initially reported ( without any evidence ) that Campos was not an innocent victim wounded in the course of his duties , but was actually suspected of being an accomplice in the mass shooting . 
0	121	" On 12 October 2017 , an impostor CNN lookalike web site doubled down on that tidbit of fake news by posting an article holding that Campos ( whose name was repeatedly misspelled as "" Compos "" ) was not only suspected of being an accomplice to the shooting , but had actually been arrested on the grounds that he , too , shot at concert - goers from the Mandalay Bay 's 32nd floor suite — and then shot the real perpetrator in the head ( fatally ) and himself in the arm ( superficially ) to provide cover for his actions : "
0	121	 Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Compos has been arrested accused of being an accomplice and second shooter in the Las Vegas massacre that claimed the lives of 59 people and injured more than 500 . 
0	121	 Jesus Campos had originally been praised for his apparent heroics on October 1st , as he supposedly rushed to Paddock 's suite , was shot in the upper thigh through the door , and continued to help get people to safety despite his wounds . 
0	121	 However , FBI officials involved in the investigation now believe he was an accomplice of Paddock 's , and was involved in the initial shooting as a second gunman from the other broken window in Paddock 's 32nd - floor room . 
0	121	" According to a senior FBI official , authorities became suspicions by the extreme amount of gunpowder residue found on Campos ' hands and inconsistencies in his timeline of events . "" "
0	121	" We believe he killed [ the shooter ] , shot holes through the door and his own arm to produce physical evidence for his cover story , then went and lay next to the elevator , "" the FBI official told CNN . "
0	121	 Although some confusion remains , as of this writing , about the precise timing of when Campos was wounded relative to the onset of the larger mass shooting rampage , law enforcement has not at any time suggested that Campos was an accomplice to that mass shooting , much less taken him into custody on that basis .

0	123	A group of anti - fascists attacked and stabbed a man outside his home in Vermont for not condemning a local white nationalist . 
0	123	" On 16 August 2017 , the right - wing web site BigLeaguePolitics.com reported that a Vermont man was attacked by an "" antifa mob "" — a description the alleged victim said did not come from him . "
0	123	 Sam Wormer , the subject of the story , told us that he was met by five men outside his home a night earlier . 
0	123	" Two of the five men , he said , attacked him directly while the other three "" just kinda hung back , "" but he disputed the story 's premise blaming anti - fascist groups : "
0	123	 I honestly do nt think antifa had anything to do with this . 
0	123	 I personally believe this was a false flag attack perpetrated by the far right to further their own agenda . 
0	123	 Big League Politics interviewed Wormer after he posted a picture of himself on his Facebook page with a visible cut to his stomach , which he told us came from a box cutter blade . 
0	123	 The caption read : 
0	123	 This is social justice apparently . 
0	123	 This is what i get for sticking up for someone . 
0	123	 Cowards . 
0	123	 Wormer 's attackers have not been identified . 
0	123	" He said that even though he was called a "" Nazi "" and a "" fascist "" , he did not describe them as being anti - fascists , either . "
0	123	" He said there is a loosely organized antifa group in the area , which contacted him after the incident "" trying to figure out what happened [ and ] who 's responsible , and have been very very supportive "" . "
0	123	 Wormer , who has not sought medical attention but filed a police report after the attack , first attracted media attention when he was interviewed in a Burlington Free Press story about Ryan Roy , a local man who was fired from his job after being identified as one of the participants in a white supremacist march held in Charlottesville , Virginia on 11 August 2017 . 
0	123	 Roy described himself as a white nationalist and supporter of President Donald Trump to the Free Press . 
0	123	 He also said : 
0	123	 Obviously I would advocate for racial separation and racial nationalism or repatriation or even a return to — our country was a white country up until the 1965 Hart - Celler Immigration Act . 
0	123	" That legislation , which was signed into law by then - President Lyndon B. Johnson on 3 October 1965 and went into effect in June 1968 , did away with quotas for immigrants to the U.S. based on their country of origin and instead gave priority to immigrants whose relatives already lived in the country , as well as those with "" specialized skills . "" . "
0	123	" According to Wormer , he was "" completely shocked "" to see Roy in a Vice News report about the rally and did not agree with his beliefs , but still opposed subsequent demands online for him to be fired or lose custody of his child . "
0	123	 Taking away somebody 's job and livelihood — I mean , that 's just adding fuel to the fire . 
0	123	 I do n't think any good is going to come of this on anybody 's side . 
0	123	 He said that he was attacked shortly after he made a separate comment about Roy on Facebook , which read : 
0	123	 I believe he 's doing what he truly believes is right , and despite all the anger and hate pointed his way right now he stands by his choices . 
0	123	 There 's a lot to be said for that . 
0	123	 I respect him for that , and I wo n't stand with those people who are trying to have Ryan 's child taken away or have him fired . 
0	123	 I ca n't , he and his family have done too much for me . 
0	123	 Sorry but my allegiance is with Ryan no matter his choice , even if I ca n't agree with him . 
0	123	 You can hate me for it , but I stand with my decision and if any violence comes his way I will stand with him . 
0	123	 I do n't agree with his actions but he has stuck up for me and other marginalized people when nobody else would . 
0	123	 That is what family does . 
0	123	" Wormer said besides the attack on him , his roommate and his roommate 's mother also received death threats , including "" a threatening call "" . "
0	123	 Wormer also told us that Roy contacted him after the attack : 
0	123	 He and his mother both reached out to me and made sure I was okay and safe , and thanked me for standing up for him . 
0	123	" Police in Essex Junction , where Wormer lives , told us they have "" nothing currently to report "" on the matter . "
0	123	 But Wormer said he would press charges if the people responsible were caught . 
0	123	" "" I do n't want anyone else to get hurt , "" he said . "

1	127	" "" I ca n't believe that I 'm saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women . "" "
1	127	 And so First Lady Michelle Obama captured the sentiments of a majority of Americans during an emotional stump speech for Hillary Clinton on Thursday afternoon that lambasted Republican nominee Donald Trump 's repeated demeaning and derogatory treatment of women . 
1	127	" Speaking before a crowd in Manchester , New Hampshire , Mrs. Obama stated that the leaked Access Hollywood video of Trump bragging about groping , kissing , and trying to have sex with women has "" shaken [ her ] to [ her ] core . "" "
1	127	" "" It would be dishonest and disingenuous to move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream , "" the first lady said . "" "
1	127	 We ca n't sweep this under the rug as another sad footnote in a disturbing election season . 
1	127	" This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior . "" "
1	127	" Refusing to call Trump by name — only referring to him as Hillary Clinton 's "" opponent ""— Mrs . "
1	127	" Obama denounced the Republican candidate 's defense of his past remarks as simple "" locker room talk "" while explaining how personal these comments felt to her — and for all women . "
1	127	 For Trump , the 2005 Access Hollywood appearance was not an isolated incident . 
1	127	 He has gone on record numerous times to comment on women in , typically , one of two ways : As objects of his own sexual gratification or as threats that should be wholly diminished for their intellect , ambition , or appearance . 
1	127	" Though Trump has repeatedly claimed the "" locker room talk "" defense since the tape leaked last Friday , numerous women have since come forward to report their own sexual assaults at the hands of Donald Trump — meaning that this was n't just talk , it was predatory action . "
1	127	 Like millions of Americans , Mrs. Obama , felt shock and outrage over Trump 's behavior , and could not believe that there are still people in this country who view women with such little regard , let alone the fact that one of them is trying to become the next president of the United States . 
1	127	" "" This is not normal . "
1	127	 This not politics as usual . 
1	127	" This is disgraceful , "" Mrs. Obama said . "" "
1	127	" It does n't matter what party you belong to — Democrat , Republican , Independent — no woman deserves to be treated this way . "" "
1	127	" Asserting that Trump is in no way qualified for the executive branch or be a role model for children who look up to the president , the first lady then praised Hillary Clinton for her longstanding commitment to public service ( even saying that she has more experience than both "" Barack or Bill "" ) , before declaring that the former secretary of state would be the only candidate who could unite the country and guide the American public with strength and compassion . "
1	127	 Making a call to undecided voters , Mrs. Obama urged them not to cast a protest vote or sit the election out entirely , saying that doing so would only help clear a path for Trump to the White House . 
1	127	 She referenced the 2012 election , in which President Obama won New Hampshire by 4,000 votes . 
1	127	 Though that figure might have seemed like a definitive win for the incumbent president , it broke down to a total of just 66 votes per precinct — or , dozens of votes that could make or break a candidate 's victory . 
1	127	 She additionally cited the power of women voters in this election , and the influence they can have in choosing the next president . 
1	127	 A recent report from Nate Silver 's FiveThirtyEight election forecast suggested that if only women voted , Hillary Clinton would win by an overwhelming majority ( which , horrifyingly , prompted a # Repealthe19th social media campaign among Trump supporters ) . 
1	127	 Mrs. Obama invited all women to take this power seriously and use it to elect a candidate who has not only been a pillar of support for women , but would teach America 's children that any kind of degrading , hateful rhetoric is wholly unacceptable . 
1	127	" "" We , as women , have all the power we need to determine the outcome of this election , "" Mrs. Obama said . "" "
1	127	 We have the knowledge , we have a voice , we have a vote . 
1	127	" And on November 8 , we as women , we as Americans , we as decent human beings , can declare that enough is enough and we do not tolerate this kind of behavior . ""Michelle Obama Expressed the Horror We 're All Feeling About Donald Trump 's Treatment of Women"
0	128	The newly - installed constitutional assembly led by President Nicolas Maduro has ousted Venezuela 's chief prosecutor on Saturday , a move that signals that the embattled government is making swift moves to consolidate power . 
0	128	" Hails of "" traitor "" and "" justice has arrived "" erupted from the 545 pro - government delegates during the unanimous vote to remove the top law enforcement official , Luisa Ortega , from her post . "
0	128	 The assembly replaced her with a staunch government supporter . 
0	128	 The delegates said they were acting in response to a ruling by the government - attacked Supreme Court , which was separately considering a request to sanction Ortega . 
0	128	 Speaking to journalists after her removal , Ortega said dozens of national guardsmen in riot gear barred her from entering her office , alleging that authorities wanted to get their hands on sensitive information implicating high - level officials in dirty dealings .

0	128	 Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro plans to seat a new controversial constituent assembly in an effort to rewrite the country 's constitution despite continued opposition protests . 
0	128	 The new legislative body 's constitution would nullify the other branches of government , leading opposition leaders to call on citizens to protest in the streets in objection . 
0	128	 Maduro is expected to seat the 545-member body at the legislative palace in the capital of Caracas on Friday , just yards from the opposition - led National Assembly .

0	128	 Maduro 's assembly was elected on Sunday , despite opposition claims that the election itself was rigged in favor of Maduro supporters , resulting in a boycott . 
0	128	" The U.S. State Department condemned the assembly on Thursday , claiming the rigged election only served to empower "" the Maduro dictatorship . "" "
0	128	 Several U.S. lawmakers joined in the condemnation , including Sen. Marco Rubio who issued a message of support to the Venezuelan people in Spanish . 
0	128	" "" At a time of deep divisions in our own politics , both the left and the right here in the United States support the people of Venezuela and condemn the Maduro government , "" said Rubio . "" "
0	128	" Even those who sympathized and defended the late Hugo Chavez , condemn the direction Nicolas Maduro has taken your country . "" "
0	128	" The senator added that Venezuelans are "" only a free and fair election away from a better future . "" "
0	128	" Sen. Bob Menendez , senior member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , claimed a "" sham election "" was used to elect the pro - Maduro assembly . "
0	128	" "" Nicolas Maduro 's decision to move forward with a sham election to create a constituent assembly and shred his country 's constitution offers yet another disturbing example of how dangerously unfit this man is to lead country , "" said Menendez in a statement released on Monday . "

1	132	Louis Smith was found guilty of a breach of British Gymnastics ' Standards of Conduct 
1	132	 Through their bullying demands for submission to their dogma they are destroying the very liberties on which our democratic society is based . 
1	132	 A disturbing example of this trend can be seen in the case of British gymnast Louis Smith , who was punished this week by officialdom for showing insufficient reverence towards Islam . 
1	132	 The action against him by his professional body British Gymnastics arose after a video emerged of Smith and fellow gymnast Luke Carson joking about the religion at a private wedding in a Northamptonshire hotel . 
1	132	" In the footage which caused the furore Carson mimicked the Islamic prayer practice and shouted "" Allah Akbar "" , while Smith laughed at his antics . "
1	132	 For this behaviour Smith has been turned into a pariah . 
1	132	 He has received death threats from jihadists and vilification from the media . 
1	132	 On Tuesday a disciplinary panel at British Gymnastics suspended him from competition for two months and warned him that the reprimand will stay on his record for two years . 
1	132	 Smith committed no legal offence . 
1	132	 Louis Smith holds his Member of the British Empire ( MBE ) medal in 2012 
1	132	 He did not physically hurt anyone but in today 's Britain he is guilty of a thought crime by daring to indulge in religious satire . 
1	132	 It is like a modern version of the Cromwellian regime that existed in the 17th century with its determination to crack down on any signs of heresy , only now the faith held to be sacred and inviolable is not Protestantism but Islam . 
1	132	 In this new climate of creeping totalitarianism any mockery of the Muslim faith , even in private , will not be tolerated . 
1	132	 The anachronistic law against blasphemy was meant to have been swept away in 2008 but the offence has returned with a vengeance due to the accelerating Islamification of Britain . 
1	132	 Louis Smith has effectively been treated as a blasphemer against Islam and is now forced to undergo public penitence for his sins . 
1	132	 He was hauled up in front of ITV 's Loose Women , who had decided to appoint themselves as the guardians of the new official orthodoxy . 
1	132	 One panellist , TV presenter June Sarpong , was ferocious in her condemnation , accusing Smith of racism , xenophobia and prejudice . 
1	132	 But this goes to the heart of the problem with this case . 
1	132	 His critics pretend that any kind of criticism of Islam is a form of racism or bigotry . 
1	132	 Ola Jordan and Louis Smith on Strictly Come Dancing 
1	132	" In the same vein Muslim leaders constantly talk of "" Islamophobia "" if any of their religious sensitivities are challenged . "
1	132	 But Islam is not a race , it is a belief system , and like all faiths it should be open to questioning , censure or humour . 
1	132	 The idea that any religion , especially one as controversial as Islam , should be above debate is repugnant . 
1	132	 Religious freedom is one of the cornerstones of our civilisation . 
1	132	 The alternatives are absolutist theocracy and violent sectarianism , precisely the characteristics of too many Muslim societies in the Middle East and Asia . 
1	132	" In the wake of the Louis Smith incident the Muslim Council of Britain predictably bleated about "" Islamophobia "" , arguing that British society must "" realise the need for people to follow their faith with dignity "" . "
1	132	 The council should also recognise the need to abide by the values of our country , one of which is open discourse free from clerical tyranny . 
1	132	 It is disgraceful that British Gymnastics , like so many other craven public authorities , is eager to do the work of the zealots . 
1	132	 By punishing Smith they are effectively endorsing the hardliners . 
1	132	" The chief executive Jennie Allen said that competitors such as Smith and Carson should "" use their profile to have a positive impact on sport and communities "" . "
1	132	 Louis Smith in training 
1	132	 The implication is that athletes must suspend their own opinions and instead act as evangelists for the ruling doctrine of political correctness . 
1	132	 Equally offensive are the grotesque double standards . 
1	132	 British Gymnastics and the media would have never worked themselves up into such a froth of phoney indignation if Smith had mocked Catholic prayer rituals . 
1	132	 In fact Christianity is subject to constant attacks and satire without any demands for disciplinary action . 
1	132	 Joking about the Christian faith has long been a key ingredient of British comedy from Dave Allen to Father Ted . 
1	132	 Nor does the state show much respect for Christian sensibilities , as highlighted by the case where a firm of devout bakers in Belfast was fined for refusing to make a cake with a political slogan in favour of gay marriage . 
1	132	" The reason for this hypocrisy is simple : Islamic grievances and demands for special treatment come cloaked with the menace of violence . "" "
1	132	" Our religion will not be mocked "" is a threat , not a plea . "

1	132	 The intimidation is real , as shown by the relentless catalogue of global slaughter against those deemed to have offended Islam . 
1	132	 But instead of defending our freedoms , Western rulers wallow in desperate appeasement dressed up as tolerance . 
1	132	 The determination to punish Louis Smith is the flipside of officialdom 's impulse to surrender , as shown in the growing acceptance of sharia courts .

0	133	Hotel Guard Opens Up 
0	133	 Jesus Campos , the Mandalay Bay security guard who alerted police to the Las Vegas shooter , is speaking out for the first time about the violent encounter that left him with gunshot wounds . 
0	133	 Jesus opened up to Ellen DeGeneres ... detailing the harrowing moments leading up to him discovering Stephen Paddock on the 32nd floor , just as he was starting to open fire on the crowd of concertgoers below . 
0	133	 He thinks a loud slamming door during his routine check of the floor is what tipped off his location to Paddock , who then started shooting into the hallway -- and hit Campos in the leg . 
0	133	 Miraculously , Campos says he was still able to somehow get on his radio and tell his team shots had been fired .

0	134	Ever since a 2015 poll revealed that a certain slice of Americana supported bombing Agrabah , the fictional city Disney 's Aladdin calls home , it 's been interesting to consider what other fictional countries have actually messed with the United States and totally gotten a pass . 
0	134	 Agrabah did n't actually damage its relations with the U.S. , presumably because the U.S. either does n't exist yet in that world , or because they do n't have oil . 
0	134	 Or because Magic is n't considered a WMD ... yet . 
0	134	 Meanwhile , a number of other countries have attacked America and/or its American heroes and have n't yet met the full - on retaliation they deserve . 
0	134	 1 . 
0	134	" Pottsylvania — "" Rocky and Bullwinkle "" "
0	134	 These guys have been sending special agents to try and kill American heroes FOR YEARS . 
0	134	 Pottsylvania is populated entirely by special agents and saboteurs . 
0	134	" Their children are taught assassination techniques and espionage practices from an early age , their highest medal is the Double Cross and their mysterious dictator ( known only as "" Fearless Leader "" ) makes Kim Jong - Un look like a teddy bear . "
0	134	 Their two most active agents are skilled infiltrators and have never been captured . 
0	134	 They are pictured on this surveillance photo , planting an IED . 
0	134	 2 . 
0	134	" Bilya — "" Iron Eagle "" "
0	134	 Bilya is supposed to be a fictional Arab state in the Middle East . 
0	134	 These guys had the balls to shoot down an American F-16 , capture its pilot , and then sentence him to hang in a show trial . 
0	134	 This is not the face of someone who is just going to let that happen . 
0	134	 Luckily , the pilot 's 16-year - old son Doug ( an Air Force Academy reject ) and Chappie , an Air Force Reserve pilot , steal two F-16s of their own and fly off to Bilya to rescue him . 
0	134	 What should have happened was America launching an all - out raid on Bilyan infrastructure and military targets . 
0	134	 Then , after they released the American they took for no reason , the Bilyans would pay us back the $ 18 million they owe us for shooting down our F-16 . 
0	134	 3 . 
0	134	" Val Verde — "" Commando , "" "" Predator , "" and "" Die Hard 2 "" "
0	134	 This nondescript South American country has more coups than a flock of pigeons ( say that sentence aloud for the full effect ) . 
0	134	 For some reason , all of their worst representatives seem to end up in the United States , ready to coerce American heroes to do their bidding . 
0	134	 Fortunately , John Matrix lives inside an unlimited ammo cheat code world . 
0	134	" In "" Commando , "" a deposed dictator named Arius kidnaps John Matrix ' daughter to force him to kill the current president ( of Val Verde ) . "
0	134	 Spoiler Alert : he does n't even make it to Val Verde . 
0	134	 Instead , he ices every single person who came near his daughter . 
0	134	 I hope Val Verde at least has good veteran 's hospitals . 
0	134	" In "" Die Hard 2 , "" terrorists hit an airport to free another captured dictator , ruining John McClane 's Christmas , everyone 's flight schedules , and never taking any blame for what they do . "
0	134	 And that is United Airlines ' job .

0	134	 Latveria - Marvel Comics Latveria : a perfectly normal country .

0	134	 Doom is responsible for the proliferation of chemical weapons , attempted assassinations of allied heads of state , and oh so many crimes against humanity .

0	135	The US Supreme Court has ruled that Donald Trump 's ban on travellers from six Muslim - majority countries and two others can go into full effect , even as legal challenges against the executive order continue in several states . 
0	135	 The ban means that the US can refuse entry visas to travellers from Chad , Iran , Libya , Somalia , Syria and Yemen , as well as North Korea and Venezuela . 
0	135	" "" The ruling does not mean that the Supreme Court has accepted the ban as constitutional , but that it finds persuasive the Trump administration 's argument that an emergency injunction against the ban was unnecessary , "" The Guardian reports . "

0	136	 The Daily Beast reported Thursday that the Department of Justice has taken an interest in a familiar subject — the infamous email server of the former Democratic presidential candidate and her alleged bungling of classified information . 
0	136	 Citing a source close to Attorney General Jeff Sessions , The Daily Beast claims that the Justice Department wants to know how those tasked with investigating Clinton 's private email server went about their probe . 
0	136	" DOJ officials are also reportedly interested in tallying the classified material contained in her emails and finding out "" who put that information into an unclassified environment , "" The Daily Beast says . "
0	136	" Before Clinton was cleared of criminal wrongdoing by the FBI in July 2016 , the former secretary of state claimed that many of the emails on her server were classified after the fact or that she was unaware of which "" headers "" denoted that an email was classified . "
0	136	 Clinton 's emails are a favorite grievance of President Trump , who has repeatedly called for his erstwhile political rival to be investigated again . 
0	136	 As such , people within the DOJ are reportedly concerned that Trump 's vocal tweets on the matter could cause the impression that the law enforcement agency is only doing the president 's bidding . 
0	136	" An unnamed former DOJ official even suggested to The Daily Beast that it was "" an open question "" if this inquiry would occur "" without a political directive from the White House . "" "
0	136	 The Justice Department would not comment on the reported inquiry to The Daily Beast .

1	138	 When I was fourteen or sixteen - pardon me , but I do n't remember precisely , nor did these things make any impression in the international mainstream media - mom and I went to what was probably an illegal demonstration in downtown Porto , Portugal . 
1	138	 No , I am not sure if it was illegal , or even honestly what the demonstration was for . 
1	138	 Around that time it might have been for anything , including in support of whoever was the most right - wing candidate available . ( 
1	138	 Do n't get excited . 
1	138	 It was never further to the right than social democrat , and at one time it was the socialist candidate . ) 
1	138	 What I remember of that demonstration — one in a string of them — were the shots from above . 
1	138	 If my memory serves me ( and understand that after these many years things run together , but be patient , there 's a point to this ) , the demonstration was in Avenida dos Aliados , which despite the name is a plaza , hemmed in between tallish , nineteenth / early twentieth century stone buildings . 
1	138	 I 'd guess from memory four or five stories high . 
1	138	 The shots came from either the upper windows or the roof of one of these buildings . 
1	138	 As someone in the crowd , I remember people startled , starting to move , eddies in the packed multitude , and then someone ahead of us going down , bloodied . 
1	138	 At that point , the running started . 
1	138	 I do n't know how I ended up running near a wall ( we were pretty much in the center of the space ) but I remember the moment a hand shot out , grabbed me , and pressed me flat against the wall . 
1	138	 The shots continued through this , btw . 
1	138	 The person who grabbed me was my mom , and for the next few minutes , we resisted the crowd going by so close they might pull us with them . 
1	138	 I do n't remember how many people were shot . 
1	138	 Maybe four . 
1	138	 Far more died in running down an underground passage , trying to get away / to the train station . 
1	138	 That last is what my mom saved me from . 
1	138	 This is also why my blood boiled this morning when Hillary Clinton ran her ill - informed , loud mouth about the shooting in Las Vegas . 
1	138	" We 'll leave alone the fact that the "" silencer "" does n't indeed render guns silent . "
1	138	 Larry Correia covered that recently in a wonderful post at his blog . 
1	138	 But even if it were possible to silence shots completely , would it be a bad thing , to prevent panic and the subsequent trampling ? 
1	138	 Unfortunately , Hillary Clinton was n't the only person speaking while wearing a stylish colon hat . 
1	138	" Facebook and probably all the news media — I 'm working on a book and at any rate have no intention of subjecting my blood pressure to that kind of hammering — are full of "" experts "" and "" observers "" and "" commenters "" talking about how this would n't have happened if we had only banned private gun ownership .The Las Vegas Shooting and the Attack of the Carrion Crows"

1	140	Iran and Russia plan to destroy Western Europe , the US , and Canada by means of a new wave of millions of Syrian Sunnis fleeing to the West to escape the Shiite takeover of Syria . 
1	140	 In my weekly column two months ago , I claimed that Iran is the real victor in the Syrian civil war . 
1	140	 Using the war against ISIS as a smokescreen , it is taking over large swathes of Syrian territory , mainly in the scarcely populated middle and eastern parts of the country . 
1	140	 In the more fertile and densely populated west of Syria , there are Iraqi , Afghan , and Iranian Shiite militias augmenting Lebanese Hezbollah fighters who were given carte blanche to do whatever Hassan Nasrallah decides to do there . 
1	140	 Assad 's strength continues to increase as ISIS and the other rebel forces lose ground . 
1	140	 The brutality of Russian involvement and the cruelty of Shiite militias overcame the anti - Assad forces , the turning point occurs when in 2015 , Turkey ' s Erdogan was forced by Russia to cease his aid to the rebels and ISIS . 
1	140	 Today , although Erdogan is an unwilling ally of Russia , Alawite Assad still sees him , justifiably , as an Islamist enemy . 
1	140	 The Kurds of northeast Syria , treated as below third class citizens until 2011 , will never agree to live under Arab mercy once again and it is reasonable to assume that should Syria remain an undivided country under Assad 's rule , the Kurds will preserve relative autonomy in their region - or fight the regime for their rights . 
1	140	 That is certainly a problem , but the main issue facing a united Syria is going to be the drastic demographic changes the country is going to face . 
1	140	 First of all , about half of Syria 's citizens - close to 10 million - are refugees , half located in Syria and the other half in Jordan , Turkey , Lebanon , other Arab countries , Europe , North and South America , Australia and even Israel . 
1	140	 Syrian refugees who reached points outside the Arab world will in all probability stay put , benefitting from the secure and orderly lives they can now lead . 
1	140	 On the other hand , the 3.5 million now in Jordan , Lebanon , and Turkey are awaiting the end of hostilities in order to return to their homes . 
1	140	 Those expectations may be dashed , however , because Syrian reality is totally changed , and large parts of its cities are in ruins after six and a half years of a cruel and bloody war . 
1	140	 Countless bombs dropped from planes and helicopters , artillery and tank barrages , mines , and explosives planted by both sides have made much of urban Syria , where most of the fighting took place , unsafe to live in . 
1	140	 In Homs , Aleppo , Adlib , Hamat and many other cities , entire neighborhoods will have to be razed and their infrastructure rebuilt from scratch . 
1	140	 Decades and billions of dollars are needed to rebuild the country and I , for one , do not see the world 's nations standing in line to donate the necessary funds . 
1	140	 Refugees will not agree to switch their tents in Jordan for ruined buildings lacking basic infrastructure in a desolate and destroyed Syria . 
1	140	 The other reason the refugees will not return is their justified fear of the new lords of the land - the Shiites . 
1	140	 Iran has been moving Shiites from Iraq , Iran , and Afghanistan to Syria for a long time in a clear attempt to change the demographic makeup of the country from the Sunni majority it had before the civil war broke out in 2011 . 
1	140	 The issue could not be more clear because it is no secret that the pre - civil war Sunni majority considered the Alawite ruler 's heretic idol worshippers who had no right to live in Syria , much less rule over it . 
1	140	 The Alawites know well that the Sunnis rebelled against them twice : The first time was from 1976 to 1982 , a rebellion that took the lives of 50,000 citizens . 
1	140	 The second time , slowly drawing to an end , has cost the lives of half a million men , women , children and aged citizens of Syria . 
1	140	 The Alawites intend to prevent a third rebellion and the best way to do that is to change the majority of the population to Shiites instead of Sunnis . 
1	140	 They will not allow the Sunni refugees to return to their homes , leaving them eternal refugees whose lands have been taken over by the enemy . 
1	140	 Iran , meanwhile , will populate Syria with Shiites from Iraq , Iran , and Afghanistan . 
1	140	 This ethnic cleansing is the Ayatollah 's dream come true , the dream that sees a Shiite crescent drawn from Iran through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea . 
1	140	 This will cover the eastern Arab world from the north , while the war in Yemen is being fought in order to create a parallel southern crescent , entrapping Saudi Arabia and Jordan between the two . 
1	140	 With the help of Allah , both those countries and Israel , the Small Satan , will soon fall into the hands of the Shiites , while Europe and America do nothing because who cares when Muslims fight other Muslims ? 
1	140	" The Shiite majority in Syria will play along with Lebanon 's Hezbollah , their natural allies , and it is possible that some form of federation might be created between the two in order to push the Lebanese Christians out of the picture , "" persuading "" them to flee to other countries , leaving Lebanon to its "" rightful "" Shiite masters . "
1	140	 This explains Nasrallah 's eager willingness to fight on Syrian soil as well as the opposition of those against Nasrallah to his involvement there . 
1	140	 The new demographic situation in Syria will convince the Sunni refugees that they have no place to which to return . 
1	140	 They will try their best to be allowed to leave Jordan , Lebanon and Turkey for any country , preferably North America and Europe , willing to allow them entry . 
1	140	" I predict a process that is the exact opposite of the one the world expects to take place when "" peace "" breaks out in Syria : Instead of refugees returning to their birthplace , expect the mass flight of Sunni refugees from the region , and expect a heightened incidence of Islamist terror in the countries that allow them in . "
1	140	 The reasons are obvious : 
1	140	 1 . 
1	140	 Former ISIS and rebel forces will infiltrate along with the refugees , because they , too , are Sunni . 
1	140	 They are filled with fury and hatred for the Western countries who were part of the coalition that fought ISIS or stood by without aiding the rebels . 
1	140	 Some of them will continue their Jihad on European and North American soil . 
1	140	 Expect shootings , explosives and ramming attacks against citizens of these countries . 
1	140	 2 . 
1	140	 Some of the refugees will not find work and live on the economic and social fringes of society , in poverty - stricken Islamist neighborhoods which have already existed for years in many European cities , and where the local police fear to tread . 
1	140	 Poverty and life on the fringe of society will turn some of the Muslim young people into easy prey for terrorist organization recruiters who arouse the desire for Jihad by describing the accepting host countries as decadent societies infected with permissiveness , prostitution , alcohol , drugs , materialism , and corruption . 
1	140	 They present the countries that allowed the immigrants entry as having done so to take advantage of them as industrial slaves , garage hands , cashiers and other degrading occupations , while the privileged citizens are lawyers , accountant , businessmen , and homeowners who take advantage of the migrants in humiliating ways . 
1	140	" It is only a matter of time until young Muslims , especially those who were taught that "" everyone is equal "" in Western schools , enlist in terrorist organizations . "
1	140	 3 . 
1	140	 Countries which allow in refugees will suffer a higher crime rate as a result , including violence in public places , sexual attacks , and harassment , housebreaking , car theft , substance abuse , unreported work to avoid paying taxes and illegal construction . 
1	140	 This will all occur at the same time these countries expend a larger part of their budgets on social services for the refugees , from child allowances to unemployment , health and old age benefits . 
1	140	 At this point in time , the percentage of second and third generation immigrants populating the prisons in Western Europe is significantly larger than their percentage in the general population . 
1	140	 4 . 
1	140	 Increased economic , social and security problems in Europe and North America as a result of the rise in the number of migrants will lead to a rise in the strength of the right and the extreme right . 
1	140	 This will , in turn , lead to more social tensions in the West . 
1	140	 Members of Parliament whose only wish is to be re - elected will adapt their parliamentary activity - especially the laws they promote - to the expectations of the rapidly Islamizing constituencies , sacrificing their own people 's interests on the altar of their political careers . 
1	140	 Many Europeans , aware of their elected leaders ' betrayal , will despair and leave those socially and economically deteriorating countries . 
1	140	 This will increase the rate at which Europe turns into an Islamic region . 
1	140	 And that is how the agreements Iran and Russia will soon coerce Syria into accepting are going to start a chain reaction increasing the number of refugees and pulling Europe down to a point of no return , without the world understanding what is going on . 
1	140	 The Atlantic Ocean is not wide enough to protect North America from this debacle crossing the sea . 
1	140	 This is how the Iranian Ayatollahs intend to destroy the heretic , permissive , drunk and materialistic West . 
1	140	 More of the unfortunate Syrian millions will find themselves exiled to the heretic countries hated by the Ayatollahs , and Iran will operate from Syrian soil to vanquish Europe and America .

0	142	"President Donald Trump forecasted that Bernie Sanders would run against him in 2020 "" even if he 's in a wheelchair , "" and mocked the Vermont senator by imitating a scrunched - up body . "
0	142	" Trump expressed that opinion over the summer when he invited four Democratic lawmakers to the White House , and also asked , "" Who is going to run against me in 2020 ? "
0	142	 Crooked Hillary ? 
0	142	" Pocahontas ? "" "
0	142	 the New York Times reported on Saturday . 
0	142	 At 70 years old , Trump was the oldest president to be inaugurated in the U.S. Trump , now 71 , is nearly five years younger than Sanders , who would turn 79 in 2020 .

0	142	 Bernie Sanders , who lost the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton last year , has started addressing some of his political shortcomings including his lack of foreign policy connections , a sign he may be gearing up for a 2020 bid , POLITICO reported late last month . 
0	142	 Other Democrats that Trump called out over the summer have not indicated they will make a bid for the presidency . 
0	142	" After Trump in October tweeted he hopes Clinton will run against him , Clinton told BBC Radio 4 , "" No , I 'm not going to run again , "" but that she would continue to speak out against Trump . "
0	142	" Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren , who Trump refers to as "" Pocahontas "" because she claims to have a Native American background , is considered a top Democratic contender . "
0	142	" In August , she brushed off the idea , saying , "" I 'm doing my job every single day . "
0	142	" I am not running for president , I 'm doing my work . "" "
0	142	 Meanwhile , some Republicans recently have cast doubt over whether Trump will seek reelection — even though he is raising millions of dollars for a campaign . 
0	142	" New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in October told the Today show that if Trump runs again , "" I would support him , yes , but I 'm not so sure what will happen . "" "
0	142	" Shortly after , Senator Rand Paul said Republicans "" need to know ( if ) President Trump ( is ) running for re - election , "" and , "" I think you wo n't know that until you get into sort of second , third year of his presidency . "" "

0	143	 It 's no secret that Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , has great disdain for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . 
0	143	 Shortly before the Democratic National Convention , the activist released incriminating email showing that the DNC had worked against Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in favor of a Clinton nomination . 
0	143	 Though that did much to shake up supporters of the American political system and infuriate supporters of Sanders , the Vermont Senator pledged his support to Clinton nonetheless . 
0	143	 He cited that it was important to unify the party and prevent a Trump presidency . 
0	143	 Rigged or not ( and it 's most definitely rigged ) , is this truly the reason Bernie Sanders gave up the good fight ? 
0	143	 According to Assange , Bernie Sanders was threatened . 
0	143	 During an interview with Australian journalist John Pilger , who is based in the United Kingdom , Assange disclosed some very concerning information . 
0	143	 Pilger , who is working on a documentary about Assange , asked : 
0	143	" "" Julian , we cut you off earlier when you were talking about what you felt were the most significant emails that you have released . "
0	143	 Is there any last one that you 'd like to mention ? 
0	143	 And also , do you have any thoughts on Bernie Sanders ? 
0	143	" I mean what is your opinion why Bernie Sanders drop out of the race ? "" "
0	143	 Assange responded : 
0	143	" "" Look , I think — you know , we know how politics works in the United States . "
0	143	 Whoever — whatever political party gets into government is going to merge with the bureaucracy pretty damn fast . 
0	143	 It will be in a position where it has some levers in its hand . 
0	143	" And Bernie Sanders was independent candidate trying to get the nomination trough the Democratic Party and if you ask me he did get the nomination , but he was threatened to drop out . "" "
0	143	 Again , Assange has promised to release incriminating emails which are sure to result in Clinton 's indictment . 
0	143	 He says he has evidence that Hillary made deals with an alleged Islamic state sponsor , as well as damning information about the Clinton Foundation . 
0	143	 The Clinton campaign knows he 's on to her , too , which is why a strategist called for an assassination of Assange on TV . 
0	143	" "" Of course , we 're very interested in revealing the truth about any candidate and yes we have some material about Bernie Sanders that will be published , "" Assange added . "

0	150	Attorney General Jeff Sessions warned Tuesday that sanctuary cities in the U.S. will lose millions in grant money if they do not comply with federal agents ' efforts to deport undocumented immigrants . 
0	150	" Sessions issued a statement announcing new requirements for local governments that wish to receive money from a federal grant program called the "" Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Programs . "" "

1	155	Apparently , condemning the NFL 's kneeling protests of the national anthem is a step too far for CNN commentator Keith Boykin . 
1	155	 He believes that , because of President Trump 's tweeting , he sees an anti African - American trend -- that Trump is a racist puppet master , attempting to pull the strings on the black community . 
1	155	" Boykin said , "" We have a white supremacist president of the United States . "
1	155	" He 's encouraging white supremacists . "" "
1	155	 And the CNN host even called him out for saying that , questioning whether he could back up that statement . 
1	155	 But , then he said something even more radical : 
1	155	 It 's not about respect for the flag . 
1	155	 It 's about fanning the flames of racial hatred and this president is a master of that and that 's the reason why he 's playing plantation politics .

1	166	In Arizona , there is a special election to replace Rep. Trent Franks , who resigned earlier this year . 
1	166	 Making special appearances to help the Democrat in that race are the kids from Parkland , Florida . 
1	166	 These are the kids the left - wing media has promoted because of their demands for gun control , since the mass shooting in Parkland that killed 17 . 
1	166	 The left 's obsession with gun control is nothing new . 
1	166	 The left embraced the creation of the Brady Center to Prevent Handgun Violence after its creation in the 1980s . 
1	166	 Other left - wing attempts to repeal and block the Second Amendment rights of Americans go further back . 
1	166	 As a policy idea , gun control has been a disaster . 
1	166	 Ignoring the fact that it is one of the preferred tools of tyrants , gun control simply does not work . 
1	166	 Britain essentially banned firearms after the 1996 Dunblane massacre . 
1	166	 While Britain , for more than 20 years , has had the kind of gun control American liberals can only dream of , the results have not been good . 
1	166	 Crime in London is out of control . 
1	166	 In gun - free London , a number of people have been shot to death in the last three months . 
1	166	 Only a year ago , the BBC reported that gun crime had risen by 42 percent . 
1	166	 How could that be ? 
1	166	 The left promises us that if we only ban guns , crime will go away . 
1	166	 In the absence of guns , many criminals in the U.K. have turned to knives . 
1	166	 And guess what ? 
1	166	 The politicians in Britain are now pushing knife control . 
1	166	 The issue for Americans is not simply the removal of the right to bear arms . 
1	166	 It is a fundamental intrusion on one of the most basic liberties someone may have . 
1	166	 Freedom . 
1	166	" Thomas Jefferson wrote in the draft of the Virginia Constitution , "" No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms . "" "
1	166	" The keywords in Jefferson 's draft were "" free man . "" "
1	166	 One of the fundamental rights that any free man or woman has is the right to self - defense . 
1	166	 Free people can defend themselves . 
1	166	 Slaves can not . 
1	166	 The left ignores the fact that when guns are used in this nation , they are overwhelmingly used for self - defense . 
1	166	 But it is this fundamental right of self - defense that the left challenges and would see destroyed in America . 
1	166	 In the last 20 years in America , an alarming change has taken place in schools . 
1	166	 Before this time , if two children became involved in a fight at school , the school would try to determine who started the fight and punish that child . 
1	166	 No longer . 
1	166	 Now , both children ( or more ) are punished . 
1	166	 It does not matter if one child was trying to defend himself against a bully . 
1	166	 It does n't matter if someone else started the fight , the mere act of self - defense becomes a punishable offense . 
1	166	 The left has this obsession with people and the nation being defenseless . 
1	166	 They want to strip away the rights of citizens to use weapons to defend themselves . 
1	166	 They do not like the idea of something like missile defense to protect this nation against an attack . 
1	166	 The left loves to preach to us . 
1	166	 They tell real Americans that it is necessary to strip away our rights to make us safe . 
1	166	" In 1783 , William Pitt spoke in the House of Commons and said , "" Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom . "
1	166	" It is the argument of tyrants ; it is the creed of slaves . "" "
1	166	 That perfectly sums up the left . 
1	166	 Their goal is tyranny and their objective is to reduce every American to the status of a slave .

0	167	 WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The Trump administration is preparing to restore the flow of surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies . 
0	167	 The government program had been sharply curtailed by the Obama administration amid an outcry over police use of armored vehicles and other war - fighting gear to confront protesters . 
0	167	 Documents obtained by The Associated Press indicate President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order undoing an Obama - era directive that restricted police access to military grenade launchers , firearms , ammunition and other gear . 
0	167	" The documents say Trump 's order would fully restore the program under which "" assets that would otherwise be scrapped can be repurposed to help state , local , and tribal law enforcement better protect public safety and reduce crime . ""Trump to undo Obama order , allow local police to have additional military - like items"
1	168	Some time back it was reported that an alert Maryland police officer saw an Islamic woman in an SUV videotaping a bridge 's support structures . 
1	168	 He arrested the driver , Ismail Elbarasse — a Hamas and Muslim Brotherhood operative . 
1	168	 An FBI raid on Elbarasse 's home unearthed a trove of Islamic doctrinal books and key Muslim Brotherhood documents — which became evidence in the largest terrorism - financing trial in U.S. history . 
1	168	" Islam 's books are "" the real bomb , "" Muslim reformer Islam al - Behery said . "
1	168	" Its ideology is "" its blueprint "" for world domination . "
1	168	 A document from the Elbarasse raid outlines the Muslim Brotherhood 's phased plan to destroy Western civilization from within : 
1	168	 Phase One : Secret establishment of leadership . 
1	168	 Phase Two : Gradual public profile by infiltrating government , the judiciary , finance , intelligence , police , prisons , military , education and religious institutions . 
1	168	 Phase Three : Escalation prior to conflict and confrontation with rulers using mass media . 
1	168	 Phase Four : Publically confront the government using political pressure . 
1	168	 Weapons training domestically and overseas in anticipation of zero - hour . 
1	168	 Phase Five : Seize power to establish the Islamic state . 
1	168	 Other documents outline the plan to replace the U.S. Constitution with sharia ( Islamic law ) . 
1	168	 Sharia is based on the Quran and other Islamic writings . 
1	168	 Moderates see it a spiritual struggle , or outwardly observe it for fear of reprisal . 
1	168	 But for radicals , sharia is the legal and political foundation for jihad and global rule , a power play to force Islam on the world . 
1	168	" The D.C. based Center for Security Policy calls it a "" totalitarian ideology "" controlling all legal , political , military , economic and social life . "
1	168	 No other laws or governments may coexist with sharia . 
1	168	 It 's primarily political , not religious ; though in America it masks itself as a religion to manipulate the First Amendment as a front for seditious activity . 
1	168	 The Quran requires all Muslims to wage jihad ( holy war ) against infidels ( non - Muslims ) . 
1	168	 Jihad calls for multiple stages and platforms — violent and pre - violent . 
1	168	" An Elbarasse memorandum calls the pre - violent "" settlement process "" in North America "" civilization jihad "" to destroy the Western way of life . "
1	168	 In jihad 's final , violent stage , non - Muslims convert or die . 
1	168	 Though jihad is obvious in North America and Europe , it 's not limited to the West . 
1	168	 The phased plan is a template for radical Muslim subjugation . 
1	168	 Indonesia , a secular , mostly moderate Muslim - majority democracy , is a case in point . 
1	168	" Its motto , "" Unity in Diversity "" reflects its six religions and 300 ethnicities . "
1	168	 Though religious parties ' gains in national elections have been paltry , locally elected Islamists passed more than 400 sharia ordinances , according to economist.com . 
1	168	" Christian incumbent Basuki Tjahaja "" Ahok "" Purnama lost a recent governor 's race when radical Islamists told Muslim voters that Islam forbids voting for Christians . "
1	168	 A video of Ahok 's rebuttal was edited to appear he was insulting the Quran . 
1	168	 Charged with blasphemy , he lost the election and was sentenced to jail . 
1	168	 $ 107 Billion Treasure Found From WW2 ! 
1	168	 You Wo n't Believe Where It Was Stashed 
1	168	" Ahok 's conviction — accompanied by violent rallies and death threats , shows the chilling influence on pluralism by "" hardline Islamism that the government and judiciary are reluctant to oppose , "" said Time reporter Nicola Smith . "
1	168	 In Indonesia , radical Islamists have advanced their plan for global dominance to Phase Four . 
1	168	 Then there 's Iran , whose visceral anti - Semitism and poisonous ideology infuses jihad and sharia , but with a twist . 
1	168	 The late Ayatollah Khomeini , and his successor , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , sidestepped Shi'a believe that the Mahdi ( 12th Imam ) , a quasi - messianic figure , must return before waging jihad and adopted an ideology promoting a senior Shiite cleric to theocratic political power over Shiites worldwide . 
1	168	" Khomeini offered himself as successor to the 12 Imams , thus "" inheriting the mantle of leadership directly from Muhammad , "" said expert Clare Lopez . "
1	168	 Khomeini inserted his doctrine into the 1989 constitution , in which the regime 's objective is global conquest under sharia rule and nuclear dominance is a surefire path to achieve that goal . 
1	168	" Iran and its proxies not only menace Israel 's existence and portend regional upheaval , the "" bomb "" of Islamist ideology threatens the lives and freedoms of every sovereign nation in the world . "

1	169	"A recent Sacramento Bee commentaryby another anti - Trump ankle biter ( "" Horrified by Trump ? "
1	169	" Just tell yourself it could be worse , "" by Foon Rhee ) talked about how horrified he was by President Trump . "
1	169	 How Trump 's belittled our allies , demonized immigrants and endangered the environment — the usual mind vomit leftists spew forth on a daily basis . 
1	169	 He talked about Russian collusion , which after 11 months and nearly $ 7 million has yielded no evidence whatsoever , and how Trump is undermining America by deregulating the EPA and repealing Obama 's health care debacle , which is true since Trump is trying to improve both fiascos . 
1	169	 The writer then goes on to say that as horrible as Trump is , it could be worse . 
1	169	 That is also true , especially if Hillary had been elected . 
1	169	 She would not only have increased the growing malignancy of a liberal ideology that has made a mockery of the presidency , the IRS , the FBI , the DOJ and the media , but we 'd have both Clinton serial women abusers and compulsive liars in the White House . 
1	169	 On Hillary 's website one can open tabs on ethnic , religious and sexual minorities all related to the nature of diversity , power and oppression , but unlike Trump 's , there 's not one mention of her vision of a true American community .

1	173	"After another week of violence and mayhem , it 's clear Hillary Clinton 's controversial assessment of Trump 's fans was , well , generous .Hillary was Wrong . All of Trump 's Supporters Are "" Deplorable """
1	174	They 've got her now , just you wait . 
1	174	 Republicans in Congress have Hillary Clinton in their sights , and it 's all going to be different this time . 
1	174	 They 're demanding that the Justice Department appoint a special counsel to investigate Clinton , or more specifically , a couple of different matters relating to her , including the sale of a company that mines uranium and the Russia dossier , in which an opposition researcher assembled potentially damaging information on Donald Trump in 2016 . 
1	174	 What America obviously needs is a prosecutor with unlimited resources and subpoena power to get to the bottom of these matters , because ... because ... well because Hillary Damn Clinton , that 's why ! 
1	174	 You may have noticed that Hillary Clinton is not actually the president , a fact that has left Republicans who were looking forward to four or eight years of rip - roaring investigations rather bereft . 
1	174	 So why not have the Justice Department investigate the president 's former opponent ? 
1	174	 Maybe they 'll get to lock her up after all . 
1	174	 Sure , that 's something that tends to happen in countries where elections are a prelude to tyranny , but is n't the American system far too lenient on people who commit the crime of losing an election ? 
1	174	 What is the point of all this ? 
1	174	 The answer is a bit complicated , but first let 's quickly address the Republicans ' complaint . 
1	174	 In their fantasy world , what demands investigation is chiefly this : Hillary Clinton gave 20 percent of our uranium to Russia in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation , and there was obviously something fishy going on . 
1	174	" However , every bit of the previous sentence is false , other than that there is a person named "" Hillary Clinton , "" a thing called "" uranium , "" a place called "" Russia , "" and an organization called the "" Clinton Foundation . "" "
1	174	 In fact , the Russian government controls a company that has rights to mine a portion of the uranium located within the United States ( far less than 20 percent ) , and the uranium is n't allowed to leave the country . 
1	174	 The sale of that company was approved in 2013 by a board that includes representatives of nine different federal agencies ; though the State Department is one of the nine , Clinton had no personal role in the decision . 
1	174	 The donations to the Clinton Foundation that supposedly were payback actually occurred in 2007 , before she became secretary of state , from a man who no longer had any stake in the company by the time the sale took place ( you can read more here or here ) . 
1	174	 As for the Russian dossier , it was opposition research of the kind undertaken by candidates for every significant office in America . 
1	174	 It contained some salacious rumors about Donald Trump , but the Clinton campaign did n't even make them public . 
1	174	 In short , this is n't the kind of thing you appoint a special counsel to investigate . 
1	174	" When this was brought up by far - right Rep. Jim Jordan ( R - Ohio ) , whom retired Speaker of the House John Boehner recently referred to as a "" legislative terrorist , "" at a Judiciary Committee hearing this week , even Attorney General Jeff Sessions seemed uninterested . "
1	174	" But Jordan and his compatriots are hardly alone ; the president himself recently said it 's "" very discouraging to me "" that the Justice Department is not "" going after Hillary Clinton . "" "
1	174	 If there 's one thing Republicans know , it 's how to work a Clinton scandal . 
1	174	 You start with wild charges , whether there are any facts behind them or not , then start to hold hearings , create a rising din in the conservative media , and before you know it , you 've woven a scandal out of nothing . 
1	174	 Of course , you have to pretend that you care very deeply about consular security or proper email management or whatever the ostensible topic of the scandal is , but they can manage that without too much trouble . 
1	174	 This formula has to be understood as serving multiple goals . 
1	174	 In the short run , it merely makes trouble for Democrats , putting them on the defensive and dominating the news . 
1	174	 Now that Trump is president , it could also help distract attention from the administration 's scandals . 
1	174	" Since this story involves Russia too , it can potentially create a fog in the addled mind of the American public , to the point where "" Russia "" is just associated with a bunch of Washington corruption that involves both parties . "
1	174	 In the longer run , the investigation can act as a lever , producing something more consequential than whatever it set out to investigate . 
1	174	 Republicans do n't have to know what they 're fishing for at the outset ; it 's enough to hope that there might be something waiting to be uncovered . 
1	174	 The Benghazi investigation revealed the existence of Clinton 's private email server , so who knows what an investigation into the uranium company might produce ? 
1	174	 And then there 's the emotional component . 
1	174	 Investigating Hillary Clinton promises a return to a simpler time , when Republicans felt a sense of righteousness and purpose , and did n't have to worry about crafting complicated legislation that required difficult tradeoffs . 
1	174	 That stuff is just no fun . 
1	174	 The trouble with the project , however , to return to where we started , is that Hillary Clinton is not the president and is never going to be the president . 
1	174	 She 's gone . 
1	174	 There is n't anything to be gained by rooting around like pigs hoping to unearth a truffle of scandal buried somewhere in the woods of Chappaqua . 
1	174	 All it does is make them look like sore winners . 
1	174	 Which of course is exactly what they are . 
1	174	 Nothing in the last year has turned out the way they thought it would , and they have no idea what to do about it . 
1	174	 A good Clinton scandal would make everything make sense again . 
1	174	 But they probably wo n't get it , so they 'll just have to content themselves with defending the toddler in the Oval Office and worrying about which of their candidates are going to turn out to have a thing for teenage girls . 
1	174	 Oh — and maybe passing some legislation . 
1	174	 If they get around to it .Republicans ' hilariously pathetic attempt to manufacture another Hillary Clinton scandal
1	175	The line of Republican cowards attempting to curry favor with Donald Trump stretches out the door , around the building , down the block , through the next door overflow room , and extends up to space , where it circles around the moon like Dr Manhattan . 
1	175	 There 's sniveling turdface Ted Cruz , who , among other things , listened to Trump call his wife ugly and his dad a traitor and a murderer . 
1	175	 There 's J Crew crewneck used to wipe pig vomit off of a misspelled yield sign Paul Ryan , who Trump has basically played the one - way dozens with for three years . 
1	175	 And of course there 's Most Racist Cracker Barrel Manager Ever Jefferson Sessions , who 's remained mute as a Nazi church mouse as Trump continues to drink his milkshake on Twitter every day . 
1	175	 But none of these cowards compare to the cowardice standard exhibited by John McCain ; whose cowardice is legion and legendary , massive and magnificent . 
1	175	" It 's been only two years since Darth Cheeto — who was then still just Anakin Skyrapist — doubted McCain 's war hero bonafides and added ( quite humorously , I must admit ) "" I like people that were n't captured . "" "
1	175	 And now , here 's McCain jumping out of his government - funded death futon to deny government - funded death futons to other sick people , all to support a President who disrespected the fuck out of him and whose only substantive agenda and platform is to erase everything the preceding President did . 
1	175	 Again , Washington is full of cowards . 
1	175	 But what makes McCain 's cowardice special is that his whole entire personal and political brand is bravery . 
1	175	" Well , "" bravery . "" "
1	175	 You expect people like Ted Cruz and Paul Ryan to be rats . 
1	175	 But John McCain has created , attached himself to , and submerged himself in this maverick narrative ; that he 's somehow different from the rest of those craven motherfuckers . 
1	175	 That he does what he does , but does what he does with integrity . 
1	175	 And this story only exists and has been able to persist because he was a bad pilot . 
1	175	" His "" bravery "" is to bravery what Arby 's "" roast beef "" is to roast beef . "

0	176	 A decades - old virtual kidnapping scam is placing more U.S. residents at risk of becoming potential victims , the FBI warned on its website .

0	176	 The virtual abductors coerce victims to pay a ransom before victims can find out that no one has been kidnapped . 
0	176	 The FBI had been tracking virtual kidnapping calls primarily from prisons in Mexico between 2013 and 2015 . 
0	176	 The callers targeted individuals who spoke Spanish , the FBI said . 
0	176	 Most of the victims were from the Los Angeles and Houston areas .

0	176	 The FBI issued the warning because kidnappers have widened their pool of potential victims by no longer targeting only specific individuals and Spanish speakers . 
0	176	 The callers also are cold - calling numbers in various cities . 
0	176	 In a recent investigation , the FBI found that more than 80 people have fallen victim to the new tactics in California , Minnesota , Idaho and Texas . 
0	176	 Those victims paid more than $ 87,000 in ransom . 
0	176	 An FBI spokeswoman for the Kansas City offices said she was not aware of any instances that have occurred in Kansas or Missouri where the FBI was involved . 
0	176	" The scam works this way : The potential victim answers a call and hears a woman screaming , "" Help me ! "" "
0	176	 The victim might blurt out a name , like Mary , asking her if she 's OK . 
0	176	 At that point , the caller will tell the victim that Mary has been kidnapped and she will be harmed if ransom is n't paid quickly . 
0	176	 The scam is successful when victims do n't know the whereabouts of their loved ones . 
0	176	 The scammers typically demand that the ransoms are wired to Mexico . 
0	176	 The amount is typically less than $ 2,000 because of legal restrictions for wiring larger amounts across the border , the FBI said . 
0	176	 However , two victims in Houston were coerced to pay larger ransoms by making money drops . 
0	176	 A federal grand jury charged a 34-year - old Houston woman in July with 10 counts , including wire fraud and money laundering , for her involvement in the scam . 
0	176	 The charges are the first federal indictment in a virtual kidnapping case , the FBI said .

1	177	Donald Trump could win the US election next November 8 
1	177	 This question is entirely rhetorical because the BBC and its crew of analysts and right - on comedians have told us already : America will be engulfed by a tidal wave of sexism , racism and xenophobia ; the dollar will collapse and with it the global economy ; by the end of his first week Trump will be so drunk with power that he 'll make a clumsy pass at some White House intern , miss and accidentally press the red button which triggers a nuclear war … 
1	177	 Call me an optimistic fool but I do n't believe any of this nonsense . 
1	177	 Not only do I think that a Donald Trump presidency would be far less disastrous than a Hillary Clinton one but I 'd even suggest - albeit cautiously - that the world might become a better , safer , more prosperous place . 
1	177	 The world could be safer if Donald Trump wins against Hillary Cliton 
1	177	 Let me stress that Donald Trump is by no means my dream candidate for the post of the next leader of the free world . 
1	177	 I perfectly well accept that he is a vulgar , rude , bullying , ignorant , sexist chancer who entered the presidential race on a whim and may end up getting the job only by default . 
1	177	 But Donald Trump has at least two massive qualities in his favour . 
1	177	 The first is that he is not Hillary , a corrupt , ailing serial fibber with a dubious track record ( from the Whitewater financial scandal to Benghazi , where her negligence may have resulted in the murder of the US ambassador ) and a snooty contempt for the law demonstrated most by the FBI investigation into her hidden emails . 
1	177	 And the second is that he is not a paid up member of the Washington DC establishment . 
1	177	 Trump , not unlike Nigel Farage , is the voice of the ordinary bloke or woman who has had just about enough of the remote , spoilt , anti - democratic political elite . 
1	177	 Yes , America is a very different place from Britain but there are definitely echoes in the US presidential campaign of the tensions which led so many of us to vote for Brexit . 
1	177	 While America 's rich have got richer , living standards for its working folk have remained stagnant for decades . 
1	177	 This is at least in part because of a cosy stitch - up between the governing elite - lawyers , corporations , politicians and the overmighty US central bank the Federal Reserve - which has entrenched its own power by making it almost impossible for those lower down to climb the ladder . 
1	177	 Adding to these financial pressures are the frustrations caused by mass illegal immigration and also by the liberal elite 's obsession with political correctness , which has led to a woefully bad state education system , an increase in Islamist terrorism and a burning sense of injustice , especially among blue - collar Americans that they ca n't speak their minds and that their country is no longer their own . 
1	177	 Mrs Clinton is a corrupt , ailing serial fibber with a dubious track record 
1	177	 Trump 's proposed solutions - build a wall on the Mexican border to stop immigration , ban Muslims ( ! ) , 
1	177	" protect American jobs with tariff barriers on imports , hammer the Federal Reserve , stop wasting gazillions of dollars pretending to "" combat "" climate change - may be impetuous and in some cases extreme . "
1	177	 But the point is here at last is a politician bold enough to address the real and pressing problems that most of his contemporaries have preferred to brush under the carpet . 
1	177	 While Obama has fiddled during his eight years as president the world has burned : the Middle East crisis has worsened ; terrorism has proliferated ; Russia and China have flexed their muscles ; the eurozone has stagnated ; the refugee problem has got out of control ; and almost nothing has been done to address the underlying economic problems that led to the 2008 crash . 
1	177	 If Hillary gets in , it will be more of the same . 
1	177	 Trump on the other hand is a radical who might actually press the reset button .

1	177	 Take Russia : for the Washington establishment it 's the world 's biggest geopolitical threat with Putin being painted as the new Stalin . 
1	177	 But Trump just is n't interested in prolonging the Cold War , let alone provoking a Third World War . 
1	177	 He sees Putin as a flawed man with whom he can nonetheless do business . 
1	177	 This will appal those who just want to focus on Putin 's human rights record but may come as a relief to those who would prefer to have Russia as an awkward ally rather than as a belligerent , chippy basket case on Europe 's doorstep . 
1	177	 Donald Trump giving the thumbs up Trump is the voice of the everyday folk in America 
1	177	 Let 's hope this strategy works because one of the bigger worries about Trump is his view on Nato : he has even suggested - against Nato policy - that if one of its member states were attacked , America would n't necessarily go to its defence . 
1	177	 This is one of those areas where you have to hope that the wiser counsels of his advisers will prevail . 
1	177	 That said , it would be no bad thing if Trump 's remarks about Nato members failing to pull their weight were to concentrate the minds of European governments , ours included , on the woeful neglect of our defence budgets . 
1	177	" No one is pretending that Trump is the dream presidential candidate but then we 've just had eight years of the "" dream "" one - or so the slavish liberal media kept telling us - and he was useless . "
1	177	 Maybe the time has come for someone who really does want to make America great again . 
1	177	 And if we 're lucky perhaps a little bit of that optimism will rub off on the rest of us too .Victory for Trump would create a SAFER , MORE PROSPEROUS world , writes James Delingpole
0	178	"A "" Muslim migrant "" beats up a boy on crutches in a video posted to a site in the Netherlands . "
0	178	 On 29 November 2017 , United States President Donald Trump retweeted three videos from Jayden Fransen , the deputy leader of the far - right anti - Islam organization Britain First who was found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment in November 2016 . 
0	178	 As this group has a penchant for sharing out - of - context , misleading , and false information , it was n't surprising that at least one of these videos , which purportedly shows violent acts committed by Muslims , had a misleading caption : 
0	178	" Although the video is frequently accompanied by the caption "" Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches , "" there is no evidence to support this assertion , which in fact came , like so many other unfortunate assumptions , from its comment section . "
0	178	 This video was first posted to the web site Dumpert.nl , a popular video portal in the Netherlands , in May 2017 . 
0	178	 Although the original posting largely focuses on the act of hitting a person on crutches , and it was not shared with any claims about the attacker 's religion , some people on the comment section naturally — and baselessly — assumed that the perpetrator was Muslim . 
0	178	 As the video was reposted to other web sites , the unfounded claim that the attacker was a Muslim migrant followed it . 
0	178	 Shortly after this video was posted to Dumpert.nl , Dutch police officers were able to locate the attacker and arrest him . 
0	178	 A news report from the Telegraaf identified him as a 16-year - old boy from Monnickendam . 
0	178	 The report made no mention of the boy 's religion . 
0	178	 Further , when this months - old video was brought back into the spotlight in November 2017 thanks to a retweet from President Trump , Dumpert.nl posted a short article that mocked Trump for sharing the video : 
0	178	 ( By the way , fake news ! 
0	178	 Dader was geen moslim en geen immigrant . 
0	178	 Maar leuk geprobeerd Trumpie ) 
0	178	 ( By the way , fake news ! 
0	178	 Perpetrator was not a Muslim and not an immigrant , but nice try Trumpie ) 
0	178	 Geenstijl , the web site that operates Dumpert , also stated that the attacker in the video was not a Muslim : 
0	178	 Moreover , the perpetrator was not a Muslim , let alone a migrant , but simply a Dutchman . 
0	178	 The official Twitter account of the Public Prosecution Service of North Holland also disputed the claim that the attacker in this video was a Muslim migrant . 
0	178	 In a message posted on 29 November 2017 , they explained that the video showed a May 2017 quarrel between two minors . 
0	178	 The attacker , who was born in the Netherlands , was placed in the HALT Program , an alternative settlement for young first time offenders : 
0	178	 A video has been shared on twitter in which an argument between two underage boys can be seen . 
0	178	 This incident took place in May of this year . 
0	178	 The public prosecution service Noord - Holland has studied the file submitted by the police . ( 
0	178	 1/2 ) 
0	178	 The suspect , who was born and raised in the Netherlands , received a HALT settlement ( https://t.co/w62MNOFvug ) . 
0	178	 This has been successfully completed . (

1	183	This post is the opinion of the the author and does not necessarily represent The Good Men Project . 
1	183	" Today Trump has pulled the old bait & switch on a group of Americans called "" Dreamers "" . "
1	183	 The harpooning of DACA targets people who are by all accounts as American as apple pie : the children of immigrants . 
1	183	 They take nothing away from anybody . 
1	183	 They cost nothing and do nothing but contribute to our nation 's greatness . 
1	183	 They are fundamentally what America is all about , really . 
1	183	 This decision illuminates the fundamental character of this administration : cruel and mean . 
1	183	 No longer can there be any denying what Trump 's agenda is . 
1	183	 His tenure has but one goal : to eradicate everything and anything associated with Barack Obama . 
1	183	 He has n't even tried to hide it . 
1	183	 I 'd previously written that Trump is the Middle Finger President . 
1	183	 His one obvious competency is his capacity to give the middle finger to anyone that does n't kiss his butt . 
1	183	 Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Trump is the middle finger himself . 
1	183	 He represents a minority of Americans : mostly uneducated , working class / poor whites who feel angry and left behind . 
1	183	 They are resentful of the gains that blacks , people of color , and immigrants have made . 
1	183	 The majority of them are economically insecure and bent on finding someone to blame because they do n't have the mettle to examine themselves . 
1	183	 White supremacy suits them just fine . 
1	183	 Among the educated Trump supporters , most of them are elderly , in retirement , who have too much time to sit and get hypnotized by Fox News . 
1	183	 They parrot spitting Obama 's name like a foreign four letter word . 
1	183	 Enough has unfolded in the past 9 months to clarify exactly what Trump 's presidency is about , and it 's clear that it 's about anything but serving America . 
1	183	 At this point , he 's alienated a good percentage of his own party . 
1	183	 No need to regurgitate the stream of officials he 's fired or who 've walked away from his administration . 
1	183	 No need to replay senior members of his own party denouncing his behavior . 
1	183	" It 's become glaringly obvious : this guy is about one thing , and that is being the stand - in for a basket of American 's once labeled "" deplorables "" . "
1	183	 While this sounds like a petty insult , the polls have been consistent : approximately 1/3rd of Americans have deplorable views about black people , people of color , LGBT , and immigrants . 
1	183	 They are overwhelmingly white , and while they are not all Trump supporters , ALL Trump supporters are in this demographic . 
1	183	 This is his base . 
1	183	 Trump has responded by making every single decision he can to appease and please them . 
1	183	 Nothing offended them worse than Barack Obama in the White House . 
1	183	 As such , he 's dedicated his entire term to doing nothing other than wiping Obama 's name from the annals of American history . 
1	183	 The only problem ( for him ) is , he 's actually done the reverse . 
1	183	 Initially , it appeared that approximately 45 % of the country was in his camp . 
1	183	 This was alarming and deeply distressing for those who held President Obama as a champion of the environment , of civil rights reforms , and the people . 
1	183	 President Obama 's grace and personal skills helped pave the way for a global relationship with the rest of the world . 
1	183	 That made many of us feel safer . 
1	183	 In just 9 months , Trump has managed to alienate our closest allies , and wall the USA off from much of the world . 
1	183	 We look in the mirror and find ourselves facing a toddler - like madman lobbing hydrogen bombs at us . 
1	183	" Kim Jong Un is the perfect shadow reflection for Trump who claims to be the "" great negotiator "" who 's going to make "" great deals "" all over the world . "
1	183	 So far , he 's been successful at one thing : rolling back approximately 800 of Obama deals , mostly concerning the environment , civil rights , and immigration . 
1	183	 Look forward : 100 years from now , historians will look back to this era as the turning of the tide in American culture and politics . 
1	183	 Trump 's name will forever be etched in the books as the provocative agitator who turned America on its head . 
1	183	 For all his publicity stunts and lust for fame , he probably did n't think it would go this way . 
1	183	 Because of his monumental effort to white - out Obama 's name from history , it will forever be impossible to mention Trump without talking about Barack Obama . 
1	183	 History will show that trump would never have been possible if not for President Obama . 
1	183	" Van Jones called it "" white lash "" . "
1	183	 It 's a rebound reaction from a white demographic entirely uncomfortable with the idea of a progressive black man in the White House . 
1	183	 To make matters worse , Obama 's a far more dignified , intelligent , and graceful man than most of us can ever hope to be . 
1	183	 Who else could have enraged white supremacists this much ? 
1	183	 And who other than Trump could have emboldened them enough to take their hoods off and show their faces , marching while shouting racists chants with such shameless bravado ? 
1	183	 There are no more sacred cows . 
1	183	 When he cut funding to Meals on Wheels , most of us thought , huh ? 
1	183	 What 's wrong with you ? 
1	183	" Then it was school lunches for children , which prompted Michelle Obama to twist up her face ( very un - Beyonce like ) and say , "" what 's wrong with you ? "" "
1	183	" Now comes DACA and the whole world screws up its face and shouts , "" WTF is wrong with you ? ? ? "" "
1	183	 Here 's what 's wrong with him : there is a tiny fragment of our society that applauds this sort of attitude , and he is a slave to applause . 
1	183	 Speaking of slaves , these are the same people who , when polled said they thought slaves should never have been freed . 
1	183	 The same people when polled said they thought white supremacists and Neo Nazis were being marginalized more than people of color . 
1	183	 The same people who think the media is a bigger threat to democracy than white supremacists . 
1	183	 These are the people Trump is playing to . 
1	183	" As such , whenever he 's under fire - which is often - he goes on the campaign trail and holds a MAGA rally , where he ( in the words of John McCain ) "" fires up the crazies "" . "
1	183	 This is the demographic who hold his base intact , and according to polls should he alienate them , his approval ratings dip into the single digits . 
1	183	 Trump and his tiny base have one agenda : to wipe Obama 's name from the books . 
1	183	 Unfortunately for him , in the years to come , his name will stand in the shadow of Obama as historians will establish comparisons that will have Trump turning in his gold plated grave . 
1	183	 Thanks to Trump , by comparison , President Obama will be seen as a great visionary of supernatural eloquence and character . 
1	183	 Trump 's legacy will be pitifully tarnished as the president who did nothing but roll back Obama 's reforms . 
1	183	 He will be forever known as the president who stood for nothing more than giving a middle finger to President Obama . 
1	183	 All to appease a racist , small minded base standing on their last quivering leg . 
1	183	 They 've found their hero , the archetypal symbol of white supremacy in Donald Trump . 
1	183	 In 100 years , when history looks back , it will be Donald Trump 's anti - legacy that will give torque to Obama 's legacy . 
1	183	 No matter how many Obama regulations and laws Trump rolls back , whether it be the Paris Accord or Cuba or DACA , history will cast a glorious light on Obama . 
1	183	 Much of this will we can owe to the spotlight Trump gave him . 
1	183	 We will recognize that this dark era is the result of a progressive black man and his family coming to power , agitating the shadow of racism and white supremacy in America . 
1	183	 Because of him , the rising up of this ugly shadow that we now see so clearly is firmly in our collective cross hairs . 
1	183	 In 100 years , we will give thanks for Donald J. Trump for making the target so big and easy to hit . 
1	183	 We 'll be grateful for how simple he made it for us to see our disease . 
1	183	 We will thank him for ushering in a new dream because we were finally able to cut the illness out and begin our healing . 
1	183	 Thanks to Donald Trump , we 'll be able to see Barack Obama for the great man that he was , and we 'll build a monument to him upon the failures of Trump and his ilk . 
1	183	 I bet Trump did n't see that coming .

1	187	Quick : what is the appropriate response to the stabbing death of a human ? 
1	187	 And let 's just never mind the fact that the stabbing was completely random and unprovoked . 
1	187	 Or that the victim just happened to be days away from graduating from Bowie State University and had recently been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army and was preparing to move to Fort Leonard Wood , Missouri , for training in defending the country against chemical attacks . 
1	187	 What is important here , since it seems to be the only thing that is ever important in these situations , is that the victim - Richard Collins III , 23 - was Black . 
1	187	" His murderer , Christopher Urbanski , 22 , who saw fit to plunge a knife into Collins 's chest for reasons no one apparently knows but the FBI is investigating as a "" possible "" ( possible ! ! ! ) "
1	187	 hate crime , is white . 
1	187	 Save 
1	187	" Yes , "" possible . "" "
1	187	 As a matter of fact , Urbanski , who was charged with assault and first- and second - degree murder and is being held without bail , is a member of the white supremacist Facebook group Alt - Reich : Nation , according to NBC 4 Washington . 
1	187	" So yes , it is fair to say that it is certainly "" possible "" this was a hate crime . "
1	187	 Ah , but the story does n't end there , because why would it . 
1	187	 After Collins died , a civilian employee of the Anne Arundel County Police Department in Maryland took to social media to praise the act . 
1	187	 Welby Burgone , a police - academy recruit and obvious national treasure in Trump 's America , worked in the Anne Arundel County Police Department 's communications department as a civilian employee . 
1	187	" He was also a classmate and presumable "" boy "" of Urbanski 's . "
1	187	" When one Matt Worth posted on Twitter : "" Fuck Yeah Sean ! ! ! ! "
1	187	 That 's what happens when n***as try and get frosty with an OG . 
1	187	" Talk shit , stabbed , lol . "" "
1	187	 To which Burgone replied with a meme that he apparently found funny , even though it objectively is n't funny under ANY circumstances , and certainly not when it refers to the slaying of a fellow human being . 
1	187	 Save 
1	187	 Thankfully , because sometimes the world is n't a completely awful place , the Anne Arundel Police Department also did n't find it funny and immediately suspended Burgone , issuing the following statement : 
1	187	" "" The actions of this employee are a betrayal of the values of the Anne Arundel County Police Department . "
1	187	" Any employee who espouses or supports hateful or racist ideology will be held accountable and we will not allow the public 's trust in their police department to be eroded . "" "
1	187	" This person is , however , still alive and freely roaming the streets being a good ol' ' Murican and contributing to the "" dialogue "" on his possible pro - hate crime radical extremist white supremacist group , and will go on to find employment elsewhere and ban together with like - minded fragile white men and possibly even reproduce and indoctrinate his progeny into his viciously racist ideology , all the while hiding behind his God and guns , so , awesome .

1	188	Jeff Swensen / Getty Images Sleazy ? 
1	188	 Well , duh . 
1	188	 Donald 's been a lout for three decades , but a sycophantic news business willingly built him up until , with some help from the former ' Access Hollywood ' host ( and Hillary 's scary poll numbers ) , it decided to bring him down . 
1	188	 Donald Trump has been hiding in plain sight . 
1	188	 Or not hiding . 
1	188	 Seldom , if ever , has an American politician so aggressively acted out and imposed his unfiltered personality on the public , consequences be damned . 
1	188	 And yet , the final weeks of the presidential campaign now are wholly centered on the media 's shocking revelations about who he really is . 
1	188	" "" Well , where have you been ? "" "
1	188	 is one glaring question for the media . 
1	188	 The other is about how complicit the media has been in covering for him until now . 
1	188	 Trump is a thrice - married beauty pageant owner , a compulsive attention seeker and a sexual braggart . 
1	188	 The possibility of him not engaging in lewd , loutish , outre and , for a presidential candidate , scandalous behavior is nil . 
1	188	 Was no one in the media looking ? 
1	188	 Did nobody care about the details ? 
1	188	 Or was it just not possible to believe what was as clear as the noses on our faces ? 
1	188	 A journalist 's job ca n't be so easy as that . 
1	188	 Or , perhaps , it was just a case of not wanting to belabor the obvious : It would hardly seem to advance the discussion to insist that Trump is an oaf , brute , philistine and cad , which is , of course , exactly the shocked — shocked ! — 
1	188	 point that now repeatedly is being made in the campaign 's final days . 
1	188	" Or , as the candidate uniquely created and promoted by the media , has he been gamely protected and tolerated through stages of amusement , gratefulness ( "" It may not be good for America , but it 's damn good for CBS , "" said CBS Corp. chief Leslie Moonves earlier in the cycle , no doubt now regretfully ) , incredulity and alarm , until we reached the horror stage in September with a sudden leveling of the polls , prompting the media to act in righteous concert ? "
1	188	 The unavoidable awkwardness , of course , is that so many of the details about Trump 's particular sort of sleaziness , so many smoking guns , actually have been in the hands of the media all along . 
1	188	 The more or less fatal bullet came from the NBC - owned infotainment show Access Hollywood . 
1	188	 Billy Bush , who would become a Today show regular this summer — that is , an employee of the NBC News division of NBCUniversal — was the other party to the tape . 
1	188	 He knew ! 
1	188	 Reports indicate that inside NBC he was talking openly about what he knew since this past August . 
1	188	 Still , perhaps this was n't seen so much as news but as Trump being Trump , as hilarity . 
1	188	 Really , does the video reveal anything about Trump that was not previously known ? 
1	188	 Bush , now losing his Today role , becomes something of a tragic figure in this . 
1	188	 In the business of stroking celebrities , he now is reviled for stroking one . 
1	188	 Likewise , NBC , ever on the job of the care and maintenance of NBC stars , was no doubt instinctively reluctant to shoot one — one , as it happens , running for president . 
1	188	 Billy Bush 
1	188	 Part of the rationale about the video 's news value , and for why the media should be so righteous about stomping on Trump now , is the seeming singularity of the vulgarity in Trump 's own voice . ( 
1	188	" For those without television or internet , he told Bush , among other things , he "" moved "" on Bush 's Access Hollywood co - anchor Nancy O'Dell "" like a bitch "" and noted "" when you 're a star , they let you do it . "
1	188	 You can do anything . … 
1	188	 Grab them by the pussy . 
1	188	" You can do anything . "" ) "
1	188	 To have imagined it , to have intellectually appreciated what it must be , is nothing like actually hearing it . 
1	188	 And yet , it turns out his real voice , offering a detailed and nuanced account of his sexual views and habits , was not at all unique . 
1	188	 What he said theoretically in private to Bush he has said publicly over and over again with many variations — including agreeing with the description of himself as a sexual predator — to Howard Stern , for 30 years a leading champion of sexual harassment practices . 
1	188	 Trump himself — recalling Gary Hart 's fatal invitation to reporters to follow him if they did n't believe his claims of virtue — assured Anderson Cooper during the second debate that , in fact , he really did n't do the things he said he did . 
1	188	 Voila ! 
1	188	 Among the accounts to swiftly contradict him was one from a former People reporter , Natasha Stoynoff , assigned to cover Trump and Melania at Mar - a - Lago in 2005 on the occasion of their first wedding anniversary . 
1	188	 During the interview , in Stoynoff 's telling , Trump sexually assaults her with a sudden kiss and grope . 
1	188	 It is pretty much only Trump himself who now points out that the article she wrote based on this interview is a celebratory one . 
1	188	 Nobody else , least of all anyone in the media , is saying People published a fraudulent story . 
1	188	 It lied : People had firsthand proof the marriage was something other than what it said it was but drooled sycophantically over the couple anyway . 
1	188	 The influence of People contributed to creating the celebrity stature of Trump . 
1	188	 Now , with no more information than it had then , it wants to take that stature back . 
1	188	 Who 's responsible for what ? 
1	188	 Who 's less trustworthy here ? 
1	188	 From left : Trump with actress Arianne Zucker and Bush , who was fired Oct. 17 by NBC . 
1	188	 Another aspect of the media rationale for why now and not before involves the recently enshrined journalistic principle that the testimony of one victim brings out supporting testimony of others — and now there 's a growing list of Trump grope victims — quite putting aside the fact that when witnesses have the opportunity to compare accounts , that necessarily lessens reliability . 
1	188	 While it is wholly believable that Trump systematically mashed a lot of women , it also is as reasonable that the rudeness and grossness he has made no secret of , only now , in the tailoring of a chorus of accounts ( lawyers shaping the language of decade - old memories ) inflates to a media consensus of sociopathic if not criminal behavior . 
1	188	" Indeed , The New York Times , when it previously pursued the issue of Trump 's behavior toward women for an article in May , relying on independent accounts , came up with an entirely different tenor of story — "" a complex , at times contradictory portrait of a wealthy , well - known and provocative man and the women around him , one that defies simple categorization . "" "
1	188	 Trump , not surprisingly , now that he has been simply categorized as a sex abuser , makes matters worse for himself . 
1	188	 By attacking the media — with toothless threats of lawsuits — he fortifies its unity and its certainty . 
1	188	 But you can see why he 's hurt and confused . 
1	188	 For so long the media encouraged him to be Donald Trump . 
1	188	 Thirty years of enabling him and encouraging him . 
1	188	 And through more than 18 months of campaigning for president , it really seemed like he was going to get away with being who he was . 
1	188	 But let no one forget : The media , if it makes you — in this instance with great civic resolve — can break you , too .

1	192	Donald Trump rose to power by telling disaffected white people that the past represents the right and natural order . 
1	192	 Joe Raedle / Getty 
1	192	 The rise of President - elect Donald J. Trump is a triumph for white supremacy and misogyny that too many of us believed was impossible in the United States in 2016 . 
1	192	" Trump 's promise to "" Make America Great Again "" is a call to return us to a past in which white men of all classes could expect the government to protect their economic and social dominance relative to racial minorities and women . "
1	192	" It 's a harkening back to the "" greatness "" of a time when programs like the New Deal and the G.I. Bill created a path to a middle - class life through government benefits that were systematically denied to black people . "
1	192	 When you did n't have to let black people live in your white apartment buildings . 
1	192	 When it was difficult or dangerous for a person of color to participate in the political process by voting . 
1	192	 When only white men were judges . 
1	192	 When black men accused of sexual assault were presumed guilty and faced execution , but powerful white men were free to treat women 's bodies as their property without facing legal consequences or even outrage . 
1	192	 When men were men , and women knew their value depended on their attractiveness and subservience to those men . 
1	192	 When a high school diploma entitled a white man to a good job without competition from people of color , women or robots . 
1	192	 Trump rose to power by telling disaffected white people that the past represents the right and natural order , and he can bring it back . 
1	192	 He made no secret of who he would take our country back from : minorities , women , immigrants , Muslims , Jews . 
1	192	" And despite his open disdain for the rule of law , he often justified his mission by invoking the language the reactionary right has long used to describe their quest to turn back time : "" restoring the Constitution . "" "
1	192	 It is imperative that we stop letting the right own the Constitution . 
1	192	 Given that we 're about to have a president with dictatorial aspirations , and both houses of Congress controlled by the Republican Party from which he sprang , the public needs more than ever to understand and demand our constitutional protections . 
1	192	 We must be a meaningful check on how much damage these people can do . 
1	192	 But for that to happen , liberals are going to have to stop letting the right 's claims to constitutional authority for their preferred social order go unanswered . 
1	192	 Too often , liberals and progressives treat the Constitution as an obsolete document written by white men who enslaved black people and treated women as property that has little relevance to our modern battles . 
1	192	 In doing so , we 've ceded the ground to white men longing for the good ol' days . 
1	192	 Michael Cohen , Lanny Davis and the Russian Mafia 
1	192	 Yes , the Constitution was written by white guys who got a lot very wrong , and it would indeed be a bankrupt document if it were frozen in time . 
1	192	" But while the Founders lacked the empathy or courage to recognize that "" We the People "" includes people of all colors , religions and genders , they enshrined revolutionary principles of what liberty entails and left room for us to interpret and amend the document to be more in keeping with those principles . "
1	192	 Liberals must articulate a vision of the Constitution , because what Americans understand the Constitution to say acts as a constraint on what politicians and courts can do . 
1	192	 Historically , we 've made major strides by getting our fellow citizens to accept evolved interpretations of the Constitution 's text - for example , by arguing that segregation violates the right to equal protection of the law , and that forcing a person to carry a pregnancy to term against her will violates her 14th Amendment right to liberty . 
1	192	 The shocking election of Donald Trump tells us we have n't made nearly as much progress as we thought toward convincing our fellow citizens that all people are created equal and protected by the Constitution . 
1	192	 It 's a moment to remember that in the not - so - distant past a suffragette demanding the full rights of citizenship could be imprisoned and force - fed , and even more recently black people doing the same were beaten and lynched . 
1	192	 In hindsight , it was somewhat naive to think the country had changed so much and so quickly that it would resoundingly reject Trump 's misogyny , racism and xenophobia . 
1	192	 Right now , in the days and weeks and months after Trump 's upset victory , we must articulate a vision of the Constitution to combat the idea that our changed country is a deviation from it . 
1	192	 It is deeply unsettling to a large segment of Americans that they can suffer in economic malaise while a black man occupies the highest office , as the country becomes less white and Christian , and as women assume new roles . 
1	192	" We need to be clear that there is no going back to when things were "" great "" just for white men - the changes we 've seen are the inevitable result of moving closer to the equality the Constitution requires . "

1	193	"The driver of the vehicle that killed one person and injured more than a dozen others at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville , Virginia , is a known "" radical leftist "" supported by Hillary Clinton and George Soros . "
1	193	 Days after a 12 August 2017 neo - Nazi rally in Charlottesville , Virginia — in which a white supremacist mowed down a group of counter - protesters with a car , killing one and injuring dozens — various right - leaning web sites published reports claiming that the driver was actually a left - wing , Hillary Clinton - supporting Democrat . 
1	193	 We do not yet know very much about 20-year - old James Alex Fields Jr. of Maumee , Ohio , but such evidence as we have places him squarely in the camp of Charlottesville protesters who marched under the white nationalist banner . 
1	193	 One of Fields ' former high school teachers , Derek Weimer , told the Cincinnati Enquirer that the young man 's political views were extreme and flavored with Nazism : 
1	193	 Weimer said that he knew of Fields ' political leanings early on . 
1	193	" He said another teacher filed a report during Fields ' freshman year over something Fields had written for an assignment "" that just went beyond the pale . "" "
1	193	" "" It was very much along the party lines of the neo - Nazi movement , "" Weimer said . "
1	193	 Photos taken earlier on the day of the attack show Fields standing shoulder - to - shoulder with members of Charlottesville 's Vanguard America , wearing the group 's standard uniform and holding a shield with their logo , the fasces : 
1	193	 James Alex Fields was w/ the Vanguard America folks in # Charlottesville .

1	193	 A Daily News photog spotted James Fields ( center ) clutching a shield with a hate group 's insignia before the attack . 
1	193	 https://t.co/VXGqyD2LWq pic.twitter.com/LORfeVPquz 
1	193	 According to the Anti - Defamation League ( ADL ) , the basic tenets of Vanguard America 's philosophy are as follows : 
1	193	 Vanguard America ( VA ) is a white supremacist group that opposes multiculturalism and believes that America is an exclusively white nation . 
1	193	" Using a right - wing nationalist slogan , Blood and Soil , VA romanticizes the notion that people with "" white blood "" have a special bond with "" American soil . "" "
1	193	 This philosophy first originated in Germany ( as Blut und Boden ) and was later popularized by Hitler 's regime . 
1	193	" In the same vein , VA uses "" For Race and Nation "" as a variant slogan . "
1	193	" Following this theme , VA maintains that America "" is to be a nation exclusively for the White American peoples who out of the barren hills , empty plains , and vast mountains forged the most powerful nation to ever have existed . "" "
1	193	" All of the above notwithstanding , the unreliable web site YourNewsWire.com declared that the mainstream media were "" suppressing "" proof that the vehicular attacker was "" a left - wing operative at the heart of a false flag designed to spark civil war , introduce martial law , and take away the rights of conservative groups to assemble peacefully "" : "
1	193	 The man accused of being a neo - Nazi and murdering a woman by deliberately driving into her during protests in Charlottesville is in reality a supporter of Hillary Clinton and member of Antifa in receipt of funding by George Soros , according to reports . 
1	193	 James Fields , 20 , of Maumee , Ohio , allegedly killed Heather Heyer , aged 32 , and injured 19 others when he rammed his car into a group of protesters on Saturday in Charlottesville , Virginia . 
1	193	 Mainstream media is claiming Fields is a neo - Nazi and has conveniently produced photographs showing Fields standing with Vanguard America and carrying a shield bearing the group 's insignia . 
1	193	" Another right - leaning web site , Freedom Daily , did n't mention Fields at all , blaming the attack instead on an "" Antifa terrorist "" involved in a left - wing "" false flag "" conspiracy : "
1	193	 Although it was originally reported that the driver of the car was a far right sympathizer it 's now been confirmed that it was indeed a Democrat Party member and Antifa terrorist drove his car into free speech advocates in Charlottesville Virginia this morning . 
1	193	 It is common for revolutionary groups such as Antifa to use methods like this to implicate their enemies in order to evoke violence and start a civil war , which is what they have been working towards since Donald Trump won the presidency in November of 2016 . 
1	193	 Neither site has a leg to stand on . 
1	193	" YourNewsWire provided no evidence that Fields was a "" left - wing operative . "" "
1	193	" Freedom Daily joined Gateway Pundit , Alt Right Real News , GotNews.com , and other reliably unreliable sources in regurgitating misinformation put out by Internet "" sleuths "" who blithely fingered an innocent teenager for the crime . "
1	193	 These sites accused Joel Vangheluwe ( who turned out to be the son of a former owner of the attack vehicle ) of being the Charlottesville killer : 
1	193	 Vangheluwe , who is from Macomb County , Michigan , has been the target of death threats since these web sites named him , according to local news reports : 
1	193	 A Macomb County businessman and his family are living in fear after his teenage son was falsely rumored to have been the driver who plowed a car into a crowd protesting a white supremacist rally in Virginia . 
1	193	 Jerome Vangheluwe of Bruce Township said his son was incorrectly identified by several right - wing websites as being the owner and driver of a Dodge Challenger that rammed through counter - protestors Saturday , killing a woman and wounding at least 19 others . 
1	193	 Vangheluwe says even though he sold the car years ago , the family was being targeted for death threats from people mistakenly believing the son , Joel , was responsible for the horrific act . 
1	193	 The Michigan State Police responded to the threats against Vangheluwe by affirming that there is no known Michigan connection to the Charlottesville attack : 
1	193	 .2 ) Local media if you are contacted by other outlets there is not a Michigan connection that we are aware of at this time . 
1	193	 Some of the sites that got it so egregiously wrong — Gateway Pundit , for one — quietly deleted their erroneous posts and moved on without issuing corrections or retractions . 
1	193	 Others , such as GotNews.com , published corrections — and then congratulated themselves for doing so . 
1	193	" Freedom Daily updated their page to identify the right suspect , but perpetuated their "" leftists did it "" scenario by claiming the driver lost control while trying to "" escape "" anti - fascist demonstrators who were allegedly throwing things at his car , and never meant to hurt anyone ( a claim directly contradicted by Charlottesville 's police chief , who described the vehicular attack as "" premeditated "" ) . "
1	193	" All these reports dovetail into a grander conspiracy theory peddled by InfoWars founder Alex Jones and his ilk , exemplified in the rambling , hour - long video rant below , part of an InfoWars.com post entitled "" Virginia Riots Staged to Bring in Martial Law , Ban Conservative Gatherings "" . "
1	193	" In brief , Jones claims that the violence in Charlottesville is but one example of a well - orchestrated plot by billionaire leftist George Soros , former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) , "" globalists , "" the "" deep state "" , Jewish actors pretending to be neo - Nazis , and God only knows who else to foment unrest , start a race war , bring down President Trump , and pave the way for martial law in the United States : "
1	193	" We listened in vain for Jones to provide any evidence for these claims beyond vague references to WikiLeaks e - mails in which highly placed Democrats supposedly discussed "" controlling "" the populace by keeping them "" in the dark "" and "" desperate "" : "
1	193	" Now , if you go back to the WikiLeaks from over a year ago , the Democratic Party is sending e - mails to George Soros and back and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party , saying , "" We 're losing the public . "
1	193	 Minorities are getting into free market . 
1	193	" We want to keep people in their mother 's basements as baristas . ' "" "
1	193	 Remember even Hillary said that . ‘ 
1	193	 What are we going to do to keep control of them ? 
1	193	 Keep them in the dark , keep them desperate . 
1	193	 These are quotes . 
1	193	 Hundreds and hundred of e - mails . 
1	193	 We 've covered them , written articles about it , linking to them . 
1	193	 They did n't deny that they 're real . 
1	193	 They 're real . 
1	193	 They said what do we do ? 
1	193	 They said we go to culture war . 
1	193	" "" These are quotes , "" Jones said , but when we attempted to verify that Clinton actually uttered the words "" What are we going to do to keep control of them ? "
1	193	" Keep them in the dark , keep them desperate , "" we found nothing in any public sources , including WikiLeaks.org , to confirm it — and in point of fact , we found no published statements even vaguely resembling those . "
1	193	" We were able to confirm something Hillary Clinton did not say , however , namely : "" We want to keep people in their mother 's basements as baristas . "" "
1	193	" Ironically , the place we were able to confirm it was Jones ' own web site , InfoWars.com , which in October 2016 reposted an article from pro - Putin news site Russia Today alleging that Clinton had described rival Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders ' younger supporters as "" basement dwellers "" and "" baristas "" — which was n't really accurate either . "
1	193	 Here 's what Clinton really said , transcribed from an audio clip posted on InfoWars ( and elsewhere ) : 
1	193	 Some [ Sanders supporters ] are new to politics completely . 
1	193	 They 're children of the Great Recession . 
1	193	 And they are living in their parents ' basement . 
1	193	 They feel that they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves . 
1	193	 And they do n't see much of a future . 
1	193	" I met with a group of young black millennials today and , you know , one of the young women said , "" You know , none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college . "
1	193	" And we do n't believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance . "" "
1	193	 So that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics . 
1	193	 And so if you 're feeling like you 're consigned to , you know , being a barista , or you know , some other job that does n't pay a lot , and does n't have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it , then the idea that maybe , just maybe , you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing . 
1	193	 So I think we all should be really understanding of that and we should try to do the best we can not to be , you know , a wet blanket on idealism . 
1	193	 We want people to be idealistic … .. 
1	193	 To recap , there 's virtually nothing accurate in Alex Jones ' statement purporting to quote Hillary Clinton and WikiLeaks . 
1	193	 We 've addressed an inquiry to InfoWars for clarification , and await their reply .Is the Accused Charlottesville Killer an Anti - Trump Leftist Supported by Clinton , Soros ?

1	195	"Upon hearing about the establishment of the award in his honor , Muhammad Ali said , "" I know there will be a great tradition of champions to receive this award in the future . "" "
1	195	 He would be proud to know of all that Colin Kaepernick is doing to help change the world and fight systemic racism . 
1	195	 I have never been prouder to be an American . 
1	195	 That might seem like a strange confession in these dark times , when there is so much divisiveness in the country . 
1	195	 Every day we are faced with cringe - worthy behavior by our country 's leaders : sexual harassment , enabling hate groups by publicly echoing their messages , the enactment of policies that curtail the constitutionally guaranteed civil rights of the nonrich . 
1	195	 We who love our country are often left embarrassed , enraged and exhausted . 
1	195	 It 's as if some jokester slapped a going out of business sign on our country 's back and scribbled underneath : everything ( we stand for ) must go . 
1	195	 Then why am I so proud of America ? 
1	195	 Because , to paraphrase what Thomas Paine famously said during the Revolutionary War , these are the times that try Americans ' souls . 
1	195	 It is during tumultuous times like these — times when we are challenged to defend our most sacred beliefs with more than trite slogans on caps — that real heroes rise up to face that challenge . 
1	195	 Among these heroes are the athletes who recognize that they have a responsibility not just to defend a goal or a hoop , but also to defend American values and ideals . 
1	195	 There are certain iconic images that will forever live in our social collective unconscious of activist athletes who risked their lives , not to mention their careers , to uphold their principles and commitment to their country : Jesse Owens receiving his gold medal in the 1936 Berlin Olympics while a German runner - up beside him gave the Nazi salute . 
1	195	 John Carlos and Tommie Smith raising their black - gloved fists when receiving their medals at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics to protest injustice and poverty in the African - American community . 
1	195	 In 1996 , Nuggets guard Mahmoud Abdul - Rauf bowing his head in prayer during the national anthem as a protest against racism . 
1	195	 In 2014 , LeBron James and other NBA players wearing i ca n't breathe shirts to protest Eric Garner 's death at the hands of police . 
1	195	 These heroes remind us what true patriotism is : people caring more about protecting the principles of the Constitution than about their own careers , fame , money or even lives . 
1	195	 Colin Kaepernick , the recipient of this year 's Sports Illustrated Muhammad Ali Legacy Award , is one such hero . 
1	195	 What makes Colin so deserving of this award is that he fully embraced all of those risks in order to remind Americans about systemic racism . 
1	195	 This is exactly what Muhammad Ali did when , at the height of his boxing career , he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War . 
1	195	 Ali knew that he was not at risk of being sent into combat and could have served as a celebrity soldier . 
1	195	 But he insisted on standing up for his principles , even though it cost him millions of dollars and resulted in death threats , harsh attacks from the press and public , the loss of his title and the possibility of prison . 
1	195	 Since Colin first declined to stand for the national anthem on Aug. 14 , 2016 , to call attention to the astounding number of unarmed African - Americans killed by police , the citizens have responded with both praise and condemnation , just as they always have whenever anyone exercises their right to free speech on a contentious topic . 
1	195	 This is the same treatment bold Americans of conscience have always received . 
1	195	 People rarely want to hear the truth when that truth reveals problems they do n't want to face . 
1	195	 It 's easier to blame the messenger and ignore the message . 
1	195	 He is forcing the country to continue to have a meaningful conversation about racial inequality when many want to pretend there is no problem . 
1	195	 That 's why Colin has been vilified and glorified , ostracized and memorialized , demonized and idolized . 
1	195	 Though supporters have come and gone , Colin has never wavered in his commitment . 
1	195	 This selfless courage has inspired other athletes — from high school to professional ranks — across all sports , races and genders to make their voices heard . 
1	195	 He is forcing the country to continue to have a meaningful conversation about racial inequality when many want to pretend there is no problem . 
1	195	 Sports Illustrated 's Muhammad Ali Legacy Award was created to honor individuals whose career in athletics has directly or indirectly impacted the world . 
1	195	 On Nov. 30 , it was reported that a group of about 40 NFL players and league officials had reached an agreement for the league to provide approximately $ 90 million between now and 2023 for activism endeavors important to African - American communities . 
1	195	 Clearly , this is the result of Colin 's one - knee revolution and of the many players and coaches he inspired to join him . 
1	195	 That is some serious impact . 
1	195	 It has always been perplexing that people criticize athletes like Colin as being unpatriotic because they are exercising the rights the Constitution protects . 
1	195	" It 's especially puzzling when they are accused of disrespecting the national anthem , which contains the lyrics , "" No refuge could save the hireling and slave / From the terror of flight , or the gloom of the grave , "" and was written by a man who referred to blacks as an "" inferior race of people . "" "
1	195	 When that song is playing , it seems like an especially appropriate time to bring up the fact that 200 years after it was written , we are still treating African - Americans as an inferior race by denying them equal opportunities in education , jobs , health care and voting . 
1	195	 We praise our military for risking everything to make sure America lives up to the promises in the Constitution : equal opportunity and respect for all people . 
1	195	" Upon hearing about the establishment of the award in his honor , Ali said , "" I know there will be a great tradition of champions to receive this award in the future , and I look forward to celebrating their spirit and accomplishments . "" "
1	195	 Were my old friend still alive , I know he would be proud that Colin Kaepernick is continuing Ali 's tradition of being a selfless warrior for social justice .

0	199	In October 2017 , Colin Kaepernick told a CBS reporter he would stand for the national atnthem if he were signed by an NFL team . 
0	199	 In October 2017 , a rumor spread that former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick — who National Football League teams have refused to sign since his 2016 silent protest during the national anthem — had said he would be willing to stand during the national anthem if he was signed by a team . 
0	199	 Kaepernick was the first NFL player to sit , and then kneel , during the anthem , in protest against police brutality and racial injustice . 
0	199	 The Daily Wire web site wrote : 
0	199	 According to a breaking news report from the Associated Press , former San Francisco 49ers second string quarterback Colin Kaepernick now says that he 'll stand during the national anthem if an NFL team suddenly decides to give him a job : 
0	199	 BREAKING : Quarterback Colin Kaepernick tells CBS he 'll stand during national anthem if given chance to play football in NFL again . 
0	199	" According to CBS News , which sat down with the out - of - work NFLer for "" several hours , "" Kaepernick is actively looking for work , and is willing to abdicate his year - long national anthem protest , if only an NFL team would deign to allow him to warm their bench . "
0	199	 The sports web site Bleacher Report similarly reported : 
0	199	 Free - agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick , who remains unsigned after sitting or kneeling during the national anthem throughout the 2016 season , said he plans to stand if signed by an NFL team . 
0	199	 Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports revealed Kaepernick 's intentions Sunday . 
0	199	 These reports ( and others ) were ultimately based on claims made by CBS reporter Jason La Canfora , who has since resiled from these claims . 
0	199	 The Daily Wire 's story has been updated to reflect that , and the Associated Press has deleted its tweet . 
0	199	" However , as of press time , the Daily Wire 's article retained its original , inaccurate headline "" QB Colin Kaepernick Now Says He 'll Stand for the National Anthem If He 's Signed to a Team . "" "
0	199	 As of press time , the Bleacher Report has not yet updated its story . 
0	199	 On 7 October 2017 , CBS reporter Jason La Canfora appeared on the show NFL Today and summarized a conversation he had had with Kaepernick . 
0	199	 During that segment , La Canfora described the player 's determination to return to an NFL team , and claimed : 
0	199	 He 's not planning on kneeling , he 's going to donate all his jersey sales , and he 's planning on standing for the anthem , if given the opportunity . 
0	199	 However , a day later Colin Kaepernick appeared to allude to the inaccuracy of that account , in this tweet : 
0	199	 A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on . 
0	199	 Kaepernick 's girlfriend , radio presenter Nessa Diab , directly refuted La Canfora 's claims : 
0	199	 The reports that Colin will stand for the anthem are completely false ! 
0	199	 He has never discussed this with anyone . 
0	199	 pic.twitter.com/tWusUBJMeF 
0	199	 NFL Today deleted a video of La Canfora 's claims from its Twitter account , and La Canfora himself posted a series of tweets clarifying that he had not , in fact , discussed the possibility of standing for the national anthem in his conversation with Kaepernick . 
0	199	 Wanted to clarify one thing regarding @Kaepernick7 . 
0	199	 When I was asked about his whether or not he would sit or stand for anthem … 
0	199	 Standing for Anthem was n't something that I spoke to Colin about sat . 
0	199	 I relayed what had been reported about him standing in the future … 
0	199	 Reports about @Kaepernick7 standing for anthem had not been refuted . 
0	199	 However , I ca nt say if they are true or not . 
0	199	 Colin and I did n't discuss 
0	199	 Colin would have to address any future demonstrations . 
0	199	 I did n't ask him if he would sit or stand . 
0	199	 Our chat primarily about his will to play 
0	199	 I know @Kaepernick7 is fully committed to playing football and helping those in need . 
0	199	 What he would do during the Anthem I do not know 
0	199	 It was not the first time that a news organization reported Kaepernick 's purported willingness to stand during the anthem . 
0	199	" In March 2017 , Adam Schefter wrote an article headlined "" Colin Kaepernick to stand during national anthem next season , "" in which he cited anonymous sources : "
0	199	 Quarterback Colin Kaepernick will stand during the national anthem next season , sources told ESPN on Thursday . 
0	199	 Kaepernick no longer wants his method of protest to detract from the positive change he believes has been created , sources told ESPN . 
0	199	 He also said the amount of national discussion on social inequality — as well as support from other athletes nationwide , including NFL and NBA players — affirmed the message he was trying to deliver . 
0	199	 Schefter did not quote Kaepernick himself in the article or offer verifiable proof .

1	200	Amanda Marshall was Oregon 's federal district attorney . 
1	200	 Then the scandals started catching up to her . 
1	200	 Let 's recap her sordid history . 
1	200	 Appointed by Obama in 2011 , Marshall resigned in 2015 after allegedly stalking a subordinate and having an affair , and later faced internal probes ( no pun intended ) . 
1	200	 Marshall is the DA who pursued charges , even to the point of double jeopardy , against Dwight and Steven Hammond , the eastern Oregon ranchers who preemptively set controlled burns to stop wildfires from encroaching on their property . 
1	200	 After already serving time in federal prison , Marshall encouraged the judge to re - imprison them for a harsher sentence . 
1	200	 Those actions are what prompted the Malheur Wildlife Refuge protests in early 2016 . 
1	200	 In 2014 , Marshall was caught on camera conspiring with Gabby Gifford 's gun control group , Americans For Responsible Solutions , to scheme up new gun control laws and propaganda . 
1	200	 She spoke of wanting to force county Sheriffs to enforce federal gun laws , while also being one of the voices saying that local law enforcement should n't enforce federal immigration laws . 
1	200	" Of course the anti gun folks were more than happy to feature Amanda Marshall as a guest speaker at a summit presented by Ceasefire Oregon and "" Oregon Alliance To Prevent Gun Violence "" . "
1	200	 Now she faces ethics complaints with the Oregon State Bar . 
1	200	 The Oregonian reports : 
1	200	 The panel determined there was probable cause to bring ethics charges against Marshall for violating rules dealing with honesty and trustworthiness . 
1	200	 The case now advances to the trial phase . 
1	200	 A panel will convene , likely sometime in the spring , to determine if Marshall has engaged in misconduct . 
1	200	 Punishment for ethics violations range from a public reprimand to a suspension or disbarment . 
1	200	 The disciplinary board identified two rules Marshall may have violated , one involving criminal conduct that reflects poorly on a lawyer 's honesty and trustworthiness or fitness and the other dealing with conduct involving fraud and dishonesty . 
1	200	" Marshall 's lawyer , Allison Martin Rhodes , said Monday that Marshall "" has always acknowledged "" that she "" was not completely truthful "" when asked by a superior about the relationship . "
1	200	 Martin Rhodes has said Marshall lied when asked if she had sex with her subordinate but was subsequently forthcoming in a four - hour interview with authorities . 
1	200	" The professional standards agency opened an investigation last year after the U.S. Department of Justice 's inspector general found Marshall had engaged in a yearlong "" intimate and personal "" relationship with a subordinate . "
1	200	 The inspector general said Marshall , who now practices law in McMinnville , violated sexual harassment laws , lied to investigators and tried to block the investigation . 
1	200	 The Inspector General 's Office in March 2015 opened an investigation of Marshall . 
1	200	 She took a leave of absence that month , citing health reasons that included post - traumatic stress disorder . 
1	200	 She officially resigned on May 15 , 2015 , amid the internal review . 
1	200	 It 's just fitting that someone with ties to the Obama administration and anti - gun organizations is caught up in a series of scandals and lies .

0	201	 While President Donald Trump was inside the Pensacola Bay Center auditorium in Florida on Friday night , urging people to vote for Senate candidate Roy Moore , Ivanka Trump 's pointed comment on accusations against the Alabama Republican was plastered on a political ad outside . 
0	201	 The giant ad covered the sides of a truck that was parked across the street from the auditorium and then was driven around the rally . 
0	201	" The ad featured a giant photo of Ivanka 's face along with her cutting comment about Moore in an Associated Press interview last month . "" "
0	201	" There 's a special place in hell for those who abuse children , "" she said . ( "
0	201	" She also said in that interview that she had "" no reason to doubt the victims ' accounts . "" ) "
0	201	 She criticized Moore just days after The Washington Post reported he had had inappropriate relationships with teens when he was in his 30s . 
0	201	 One woman said he removed her clothing and groped her when she was just 14 . 
0	201	 The ads were arranged for Trump 's Pensacola rally by American Bridge , a liberal group and PAC . 
0	201	" "" Try as Trump and the Republican Party might , there 's no way to escape the truth about Roy Moore or Ivanka Trump 's own words , "" American Bridge spokeswoman Allison Teixeira Sulier said in a statement . "" "
0	201	" It 's a disgusting new low that the President , the RNC , and the rest of the Republican Party are trying to help send a pedophile to the US Senate , and the American people wo n't soon forget it . "" "
0	201	 The New York Times reported last month that Trump was angry with his daughterfor speaking out against Moore . 
0	201	 The president strongly supports the former judge despite multiple accusations of sexual misconduct .

0	202	 Last weekend saw violent clashes between white supremacists and those opposing them in the city , which resulted in the death of 32-year - old Heather Heyer . 
0	202	 She was killed when a car ploughed through a crowd of counter - protestors who had gathered to oppose a ‘ Unite The Right ' rally in the city . 
0	202	 Another 19 people were injured at the scene . 
0	202	" Reacting to the news at last weekend 's Bloodstock festival , Mustaine tells Metal Hammer 's online editor Luke Morton : "" I do n't know much about what happened - all I know is what they showed on TV and I did n't get a chance to really see it . "
0	202	" "" I do know that the same way there were bad guys that went to the liberal protests and started fights , there was a guy in the liberal side hit a guy on the right side in the head with a bicycle lock . "
0	202	 He was n't part of the people that were protesting , he just went there to be an agent provocateur . 
0	202	" "" If the guys on the right can go and mess with the guys on the left , the guys on the left can go and mess with the guys on the right . "
0	202	 You do n't really know why people do this and why they have so much hate in their heart . 
0	202	" He adds : "" The thought of me getting behind the wheel of a car and running somebody down is just incomprehensible . "
0	202	" I do n't have any capacity to think with that much hate . "" "
0	202	" Later , when Mustaine saw the full news report , he reached out to Luke on Twitter , saying : "" I saw the story you asked about in Virginia . "
0	202	" It was awful and breaks my heart to see how some people have devolved back into animals . "" "

0	203	President Trump responded to the Senate Republican 's inability to pass a skinny version of Obamacare 's repeal the only way he knows how : Twitter .

0	203	 He was joined by GOP Sens . 
0	203	 Lisa Murkowski ( Alaska ) , Susan Collins ( Maine ) . 
0	203	 The bill , titled the Health Care Freedom Act , would have repealed the individual insurance mandate . 
0	203	 It would also have repealed the employer mandate for eight years . 
0	203	 GOP leaders and Vice President Mike Pence huddled with McCain , Murkowski and Collins before the vote , which was stalled for nearly an hour . 
0	203	 A few minutes before the vote , McCain crossed the chamber to huddle with Democrats . 
0	203	" McCain 's "" no "" vote came as a shock to many . "
0	203	 Democrats applauded the move on Twitter . 
0	203	 The vote is a devastating blow for Republicans who have fought for months to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and will likely have to start the process all over again .

0	204	The NFL‘s position after commissioner Roger Goodell‘s news conference Wednesday was clear : The league wants its players to stand for the national anthem . 
0	204	 However , it appears there will be no rule passed to force that issue . 
0	204	 Goodell had a news conference at the NFL 's fall meetings that lasted about 20 minutes and almost every question was related to the anthem and player protests . 
0	204	 Goodell 's main talking point was that the NFL also will listen to its players about social issues and wants to be a part of the solution . 
0	204	 Everyone was focused on what will happen at NFL games with the national anthem , which has become the most divisive issue among fans that the league has seen in a long time . 
0	204	" "" We believe everyone should stand for the anthem , "" Goodell said . "" "
0	204	 That 's an important part of our policy , it 's also an important part of our game that we all take great pride in . 
0	204	" It 's also important for us to honor our flag and our country and we think our fans expect us to do that . "" "
0	204	 The best outcome for the NFL would be for the players to stop protesting without the league making a rule change . 
0	204	 Goodell sounded like the league hopes that if it keeps working with its players to help with their issues , with racial equality and law enforcement reform , then perhaps the protests will end . 
0	204	" "" The fact is , we have about a half a dozen players that are protesting , "" Goodell said . "" "

0	204	 Goodell was asked why the NFL would n't make it a rule to stand . 
0	204	 New York Giants owner John Mara told the Daily News that the league has no plans to make a rule about standing for the anthem .

0	204	" That 's an important part of our game and our moments , and we believe in that , "" Goodell said . "" "
0	204	 I think we also have to keep focus on this : We have about six or seven players involved in this protest at this point . 
0	204	 This is something , what we 've tried to do is we 've tried to deal with the underlying issue and understand what it is they 're protesting and try to address that matter . 
0	204	 The important thing for us is to be able to do that and take that opportunity to make real differences in our community . 
0	204	 That is really what 's ultimately going to be the important aspect for us long term . 
0	204	 Because this is a long - term issue . 
0	204	" "" I understand the way our fans feel about this issue , and we feel the same way about the importance of our flag , the importance of patriotism , and I believe our players feel that way . "
0	204	" The will state to you and they have stated to everyone publicly , they 're not doing this in any way to be disrespectful to the flag , but they also understand how it 's being interpreted . "" "
0	204	 Goodell was also asked about the latest tweet from President Donald Trump about the NFL . 
0	204	 The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem .

0	204	 Goodell said he has not talked to Trump about the anthem issue .

1	206	DACA recipients have seized on American millennials ' ability to receive financial aid and college scholarships in multiple states . ( 
1	206	 AP Photo / Jose Luis Magana ) 
1	206	 Asking the wrong questions will yield the wrong answers . 
1	206	" If you ask yourself , as President Trump did — "" Does anybody really want to throw out good , educated and accomplished young people who have jobs , some serving in the military ? [ ... ] "
1	206	" They have been in our country for many years through no fault of their own — brought in by parents at a young age""- you will surely find the answer is no . "
1	206	" However , if you ask yourself if you should support the proposed resurgence of the flagrantly unconstitutional and unjust "" amnesty "" that greatly disadvantages American millennials , the answer is less clear . "
1	206	 The resurgence of the debate over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy would put all millennials in direct competition with illegal immigrants who were granted DACA permits , whether it be through college admissions , job opportunities , or wages . 
1	206	 DACA creates competition in the higher education system that inherently favors illegal immigrants through policies such as affirmative action . 
1	206	 Affirmative action mandates equal opportunities for , and often results in a larger presence of , minority groups in workplaces and , most notably , universities . 
1	206	 Dreamers with permits qualify for affirmative action , giving young immigrants an advantage over not just the skilled worker , but also American college applicants . 
1	206	 DACA recipients have seized on American millennials ' ability to receive financial aid and college scholarships in multiple states . 
1	206	 Approximately one out of every four DACA recipients — about 200,000 individuals — live in California . 
1	206	 California allows Dreamers to receive in - state college tuition and 19 other states have followed suit . 
1	206	 The California Dream Act , embolden by DACA , has set a precedent for states to generously allocate funding to students who have entered or were brought into the country Illegally . 
1	206	 California is merely one example of states diverting funding from the middle class to fund Dreamers . 
1	206	" To fund the Cal Grant entitlement for the state 's "" neediest "" students , California has "" phased - out "" the Middle - Class Scholarship Program . "
1	206	 Implementing the California Dream Act made certain that undocumented and nonresident students are eligible for state financial aid , and that alone accounts for $ 67 million of the increase in Cal Grant spending . 
1	206	 However , California students and taxpayers are not the only ones who have felt the impact and burden of DACA . 
1	206	 California serves as an example of how scholarship and state - funded aid for the average DACA recipient creates a disadvantage for Americans of similar income classes . 
1	206	 Middle - Class American students are less likely to receive financial aid from universities and institutions , due to the diverting funds , implemented in State Dream Acts , emboldened by DACA . 
1	206	 Additionally , DACA creates competition in the workforce , for the millions of jobless American millennials . 
1	206	 Currently , over 10 percent of millennials remain unemployed . 
1	206	 There are 800,000 millennials from other countries who are competing legally in the workplace for the same occupations where American millennials are looking for work . 
1	206	 According to the Migration Policy Institute , there are an estimated 2.1 million illegal immigrants who are DACA - eligible in the United States in addition to the 800,000 already enrolled . 
1	206	 However , the ultimate issue facing both millennials and Americans is that DACA allows for unjust amnesty . 
1	206	 The United States admits approximately 1 million legal permanent immigrants every year , which is more than any other nation in the world . 
1	206	 It is unjust to the millions of Americans and resident legal immigrants who followed the rules . 
1	206	 Giving blanket amnesty to those who neglect to follow our laws is irresponsible and rewards those who fail to follow the rules . 
1	206	 Refusing to enforce the law equally , by making special exceptions for favored groups , puts a burden on citizens and lawful residents in the states ( especially border states ) with the irresponsible federal abdication of immigration law . 
1	206	 DACA also blatantly encourages more illegal immigrants to enter the United States in hopes of future amnesty . 
1	206	 Granting legal status to Dreamers streamlines the pipeline of illegal immigration through extended family sponsorship . 
1	206	 This is a slippery slope for America . 
1	206	 The narrative on DACA touts the promise of the American dream by advertising the many who have benefited from the system . 
1	206	 What it fails to mention are the impacts and burdens DACA has thrust upon the American millennials .

0	207	A lot of Californians are mad as hell . 
0	207	 Some even say they 're not going to take it anymore . 
0	207	" "" It "" is the result of November 's presidential election . "
0	207	 What these Californians are doing is organizing a secessionist movement — as in , taking California out of the United States . 
0	207	 Their movement is called Calexit , as in Brexit . 
0	207	 Their inspiration is the growing gulf that separates them — politically , culturally , demographically — from the rest of the union . 
0	207	" Hillary Clinton outpolled Donald Trump by a two - to - one margin here . "" "
0	207	" Without California , Trump would have won the popular vote , "" tweeted conservative pundit and Trump critic David Frum . "
0	207	 The Golden State has a population of 39 million people , more than any other state in the union , and more people than in all of Canada . 
0	207	 Metro Los Angeles alone is home to close to 19 million , a total greater than Ontario and Alberta combined . 
0	207	 As Frum points out , those are numbers that come with economic clout , and therein lies the rub for many Californians . 
0	207	 The U.S. without California , he writes , would be the world 's second - ranked technology power instead of the first . 
0	207	 It 's home to Silicon Valley and companies such as Google , Apple , Cisco , Intel , Oracle , and SpaceX. 
0	207	 California boasts the world 's sixth largest economy , greater than France , Italy , South Korea and India . 
0	207	 California is also culturally distinct from much of the rest of the U.S. It 's synonymous with liberal causes , from environmental protection to gun control to health care , and that has other Americans judging Californians , and not in a flattering way . 
0	207	" It 's a reality not lost on Marcus Ruiz Evans , one of the movers and shakers behind Calexit . "" "
0	207	" California , "" he admitted to the Washington Post , "" ( is ) seen as weird . "" "
0	207	 That weirdness extends to politics beyond the presidential variety . 
0	207	 Gov. Jerry Brown has vowed to ensure Californians have health insurance coverage , offered through the state - run health exchange called Covered California , even if Trump Republicans repeal ObamaCare . 
0	207	 But where the state most hears a different drummer is on immigration . 
0	207	 Californians are decidedly in favour of it , and it 's easy to see why . 
0	207	 California has the largest immigrant population in the union , approximately 10 million in total , a quarter of those undocumented . 
0	207	 If you 're not an immigrant in California , you know one . 
0	207	 Or two . 
0	207	 Or more . 
0	207	" In response to Trump 's ambitions to engage in large - scale deportation of illegal immigrants , the state legislature is considering a bill that would declare the state a "" sanctuary . "" "
0	207	 Lawmakers have even hired former Obama attorney general Eric Holder to battle the Trump administration on the issue . 
0	207	 That step earned the enmity of the new president . 
0	207	" "" Trump claims California is ‘ out of control , ' "" writes columnist George Skelton in the Los Angeles Times , though the irony is undoubtedly lost on the president . "
0	207	" Trump has threatened to cut off federal funds to California . "" "
0	207	" We 'll defund , "" Trump told Fox News . "" "
0	207	" We give tremendous amounts of money to California . "" "
0	207	" The problem is that , like residents of Canada 's "" have "" provinces , Californians contribute more money to the federal treasury than what comes back . "
0	207	 There has been much grousing about the Trump administration ever since the threats were levelled , fertile ground for Calexit . 
0	207	 The secessionists even have the support of Silicon Valley billionaires Peter Thiel and Shervin Pishevar . 
0	207	 Companies like Google have expressed concern about their ability in an anti - immigrant climate to recruit foreigners for jobs not enough Americans are qualified to fill . 
0	207	 In January , the group Yes California was given permission to circulate a petition with the intention of putting the sovereignty question on the 2018 ballot . 
0	207	 If the petition is successful — close to 600,000 signatures are required — a special vote to decide the state 's future would follow in 2019 .

0	207	 Timothy William Waters in the Los Angeles Times . 
0	207	 Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he believes secession is a bad idea .

0	208	Web hosting company GoDaddy on Monday tweeted that it has given the Daily Stormer , a neo - Nazi website , 24 hours to find another internet service provider . 
0	208	 A GoDaddy spokesman told the New York Daily News that the Daily Stormer violated its terms of service by posting a blog deriding a woman killed in Charlottesville , Virginia , on Saturday . 
0	208	 Heather Heyer , 32 , died when a man drove his car into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally there Saturday . 
0	208	" Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin on Sunday posted an article characterizing Heyer as "" fat "" and "" childless . "" "
0	208	" "" Given this latest article comes on the immediate heels of a violent attack , we believe this type of article could incite additional violence , which violates our terms of service , "" GoDaddy spokesman Dan Race said in an email to the Daily News . "
0	208	 Some Twitter users on Monday praised GoDaddy for taking a stand against the Daily Stormer following Anglin 's controversial blog . 
0	208	 Other people on the social media platform criticized GoDaddy for hosting the Daily Stormer for as long as it did before Monday 's announcement . 
0	208	 GoDaddy 's decision will reportedly force the Daily Stormer 's operators to transfer dailystormer.com to another internet provider . 
0	208	 The hacking collective Anonymous also took credit Monday for targeting the Daily Stormer following Anglin 's blog . 
0	208	" "" This site is now under the control of Anonymous , "" a post on the Daily Stormer 's front page said . "
0	208	" "" For too long the Daily Stormer and Andrew Anglin have spewed their putrid hate on this site , "" it added . "" "

1	209	Hillary Clinton greets the crowd at a campaign event in Des Moines on Friday . 
1	209	" "" Bigger than Watergate ! "" "
1	209	 Donald Trump exulted about the discovery of new emails from Hillary Clinton 's time as secretary of state . 
1	209	 Sure , they could be . 
1	209	 They could also be pleas from Clinton that Huma Abedin fetch her a skinny latte from Starbucks . 
1	209	 We do n't know . 
1	209	 And the horrifying thing is that the F.B.I. director , James Comey , did n't seem to know , either , even as he disclosed their existence to the world . 
1	209	 How strange but how fitting . 
1	209	 This entire election is being conducted in the key of hysteria , and Comey just found a way to amplify that ugly music . 
1	209	 Listen , Clinton made an awful decision in setting up a private email server , then compounded that error by dragging her feet through defensive non - apologies that gave the story such legs . 
1	209	 Now she limps to the finish line when she should be hitting full stride . 
1	209	 But Trump is as much of a part and player in this latest chapter of the email saga , because of the one - syllable grenade that he keeps lobbing at the body politic , his furious mantra over these final weeks . 
1	209	" "" Rigged , "" "" rigged , "" "" rigged . "" "
1	209	 Many Americans have come to believe that . 
1	209	 Many others are rightly determined to prove to that group how wrong they are , or at least not to add accelerant to the wildfire . 
1	209	 And so all of us , including Comey , operate in a befouled atmosphere , tailoring our actions to it . 
1	209	 Comey obviously felt that he was in a bind and clearly believed that by disclosing the emails as soon as possible — and not , say , delaying until he had some sense of what the F.B.I. was dealing with — he had the best chance of avoiding any possible charges of a cover - up later , and was acting with the cleanest conscience . 
1	209	 But his desire to be a Boy Scout may have eclipsed sound judgment here , and rectitude is a quaint , shortsighted notion in an election this rife with accusations of bias , this primed for scandal , this frenzied . 
1	209	 Were the emails in question sent to or from Clinton ? 
1	209	 Comey did n't and perhaps could n't say . 
1	209	 What about them warranted inspection ? 
1	209	 Again , he had nothing to offer . 
1	209	" He told F.B.I. employees in a memo that he was hoping , with his announcement , not "" to create a misleading impression "" of some hugely significant discovery . "
1	209	 But that 's exactly and predictably what he did . 
1	209	" Most Democrats were outraged . "" "
1	209	" Mr. Comey said he was duty bound to inform Congress , "" Bob Kerrey , the former senator and governor , told me . "" "
1	209	 Quite the opposite is the case . 
1	209	" He was duty bound to make an announcement after he completes his examination of the emails . "" "
1	209	 Indeed , he broke with the longstanding F.B.I. policy of not commenting on ongoing investigations . 
1	209	 He also defied the wishes of senior officials in the Department of Justice , according to various news reports early Saturday afternoon . 
1	209	 And he frustrated everyone — conservatives , liberals , Trump , Clinton — because his disclosure was all questions , no answers . 
1	209	 Regardless , the media went nuts , declaring that the development could bend the shape of the race and assuming damage to Clinton without any polling or other evidence to back that up . 
1	209	" "" We do n't know what this means yet except that it 's a real bombshell , "" the journalist Carl Bernstein said in a phone interview on CNN on Friday , adding : "" It is unthinkable that the director of the F.B.I. would take this action lightly , that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified emails and call it to the attention of Congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation . "" "
1	209	 A viewer could n't see him licking his chops but could hear it . 
1	209	 Even the many news organizations that stressed the possible innocuousness of the emails and emphasized how very little we knew contradicted that caution with the length , number and front - and - center placement of their stories about this development . 
1	209	 Why ? 
1	209	 The Politico writer Glenn Thrush had a thought , expressed in this tweet : 
1	209	 How is this supposed to play out ? 
1	209	 If , a few days from now , the F.B.I. determines and announces that none of the emails contain classified information or anything else of concern , will Trump and Clinton 's other enemies conceivably believe that ? 
1	209	 Hah ! 
1	209	" They 'll be shouting "" rigged "" all over again . "
1	209	 They 'll be shouting it louder than ever . 
1	209	 It would n't be normal practice for the F.B.I. , in an effort to buttress its determination , to release the emails , many of which are presumably private communications of Abedin 's . 
1	209	 And those might be too intimate for her to make public herself . 
1	209	 But now that Comey has flagged the whole batch of them , suspicion will never die . 
1	209	 And if the emails are fresh cause for concern , will that be knowable , and digestible , before Nov. 8 ? 
1	209	 On this point , too , we 're all in the dark . 
1	209	 What a steaming mess , and that 's a comment partly on this specific situation but also on this election , which has devolved into a junkyard of innuendo , lies and conspiracy theories . 
1	209	 Trump does n't bear all the blame for that , but he bears an ample share of it . 
1	209	 On the subject of conspiracy theories , I can offer some comic relief , noting that he and Rush Limbaugh could n't get on the same page about the new emails on Friday . 
1	209	" Even as Trump was praising Comey and saying that the election might not be quite as rigged as he 'd feared , Limbaugh was telling his listeners that Comey was "" just doing this to take everybody 's attention off of the WikiLeaks email dump "" that was embarrassing Clinton and her aides . "
1	209	" "" The cynical view , "" he said , "" is that Comey is still carrying water for Clinton and is trying to get everybody to stop paying attention on the WikiLeaks dump because it 's starting to have an impact . "" "
1	209	 Let me get this straight : The crooked F.B.I. and the corrupt media throw just enough dirt at Clinton so that she 's sure to track it into the Oval Office ? 
1	209	 Thank God for Limbaugh . 
1	209	 God help the rest of us .Comey , Clinton and This Steaming Mess

1	212	Now the plan is for arch - Socialist Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren to win the presidency in 2020 for a slightly postponed takeover . (

1	212	 Buffalo Springfield , 1967 
1	212	 Every major leftist movement the world has seen has been totalitarian by nature . 
1	212	" Occasionally this brand of extremism arises elsewhere along the ideological spectrum , such as Islamo - fascism , but Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany remain the archetypes of the socialist genre of dictatorship among many incarnations which clearly include today 's "" liberal Democrats "" in the United States . "
1	212	 Contemporary liberal Democrats reveal their totalitarian proclivities in many subtle ways , such as support for single - payer healthcare and all other forms of big government , and some that are not so subtle . 
1	212	 Recent years have seen a surge in the latter variety . 
1	212	 Shouting down conservative speakers on college campuses to silence their views has been ongoing , but now the practice has graduated to violent attacks on speakers and audiences . 
1	212	 There is no record of comparable suppression of speech by conservatives . 
1	212	 And why is it only the left that abides no dissent from its preferred orthodoxy ? 
1	212	 The adherents expose through their own behavior that they fear a fair debate of ideas , so they attempt to quell intellectual challenge through brute force — just as all autocrats do . 
1	212	 America 's so - called liberal Democrats resort to the most aggressive tactics out of the Saul Alinsky manual , i.e. , destroy any threat to the radical agenda . 
1	212	 Truth is beside the point to them . 
1	212	" To substantiate via illustration of such Stalinist "" politics of personal destruction , "" here are a few examples : "
1	212	 ( 1 ) Mitt Romney , as 2012 presidential candidate , was Mr. Nice Guy until Democrats got ahold of him . 
1	212	 Then the public found out that he had abused his dog , caused an employee to die of cancer , and sadistically imprisoned women in a torture device known as a binder ! 
1	212	" All this derived from the Obama campaign 's suitably - named "" kill Romney "" strategy . "
1	212	 Of course , candidate Obama 's own personal history was deemed off - limits . 
1	212	 Hypocrisy is a familiar trait of leftist totalitarians . 
1	212	 ( 2 ) Poor George W. Bush . 
1	212	 Investigations by three different governmental commissions concluded that he did not lie about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq . 
1	212	 If anything , he received the same information worldwide intelligence agencies did about Saddam 's WMD arsenal . 
1	212	" Yet "" Bush lied "" was burned into the national consciousness through liberal Democrat propaganda , paving the way for election of a true leftist president . "
1	212	 ( 3 ) Barack Obama advanced the practice of despotic repression by weaponizing every office of his government for domestic political use . 
1	212	 The IRS campaign of terror against conservative groups was only one of the most obnoxious . 
1	212	 Richard Nixon received an article of impeachment for much less . 
1	212	 ( 4 ) The grand master of personal destruction politics was Bill Clinton , who slimed anyone seen as a threat whether James McDougal , Ken Starr , or Juanita Broaddrick . 
1	212	 This m.o . 
1	212	" was the whole point of the "" war room "" of Clinton 's permanent campaign , not to mention Hillary 's "" bimbo eruption "" squad . "
1	212	 A colorful couple , those Clintons . 
1	212	 Hillary , in particular , was a disciple of leftist Saul Alinsky . 
1	212	 ( 5 ) Currently we have liberal Democrat rioters , following the Occupy Wall Street slow - motion riot . 
1	212	 Black Lives Matter extremists demand the murder of police , and the misnamed Antifa ironically lives the fascist ideal of causing mayhem whenever someone utters a thought contrary to liberal Democrat political correctness . 
1	212	 After the first violent act by a right - wing fringe fanatic in many years , in Charlottesville , the fake news narrative is that conservatives are the violent ones . 
1	212	 In reality , almost all political violence in this country is committed by the far left ( for example , a Bernie Sanders - supporting maniac actually attempting to assassinate Republican members of Congress ) . 
1	212	 ( 6 ) A telling symptom of the left 's nascent despotism is the public shaming of any entity that disagrees with them , e.g. , organizing against businesses that violate leftist dogma by supporting a traditional position . 
1	212	 For instance , dare to agree with the view on homosexual marriage held until a few years ago by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and you become a target . ( 
1	212	" Recall Alinsky 's "" isolate it , freeze it , personalize it . "" ) "
1	212	 Likewise , the revelations about leftist groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center demonizing those they disagree with . 
1	212	 The left decided long ago to downplay debate over ideas — their ideology having failed empirically all over the world — and to simply use neo - McCarthyist tactics instead . 
1	212	 ( 7 ) In Animal Farm , some pigs really are more equal than others . 
1	212	" Hillary Clinton was found to have committed numerous email felonies , and then the gutless James Comey said "" never mind . "" "
1	212	 Clinton 's Benghazi malfeasance with Barack Obama also has gone unpunished . 
1	212	 The political elite elevating itself above the law is a hallmark of leftist dictatorship . 
1	212	 ( 8) One of the liberal Democrats ' favorite slander devices is the accusation of racism , which has become the supreme insult in our society . 
1	212	 White - on - black racism , in particular , has become socially unacceptable , which actually is a measure of how anti - racist America has become in overcoming vestiges of its more primitive state . 
1	212	 Recognize , however , that for the past 45 years , the only legally permissible , sometimes legally mandated , racial discrimination in the U.S. is that which is committed in favor of minorities against Caucasians . 
1	212	" This is the extreme state of our social law , for better or worse , yet many on the left trot out "" white supremacist "" allegations more often than we can count . "
1	212	 There is a more substantive reason for the liberal Democrat amalgam 's resort to this odious tactic , beyond findings of its marketing effectiveness : Liberal Democrats can not permit the mass healing of race relations in our country . 
1	212	 They need to aggravate those relations so their side is better able to exploit the issue . 
1	212	 Is there no limit to their neo - McCarthyist cynicism ? 
1	212	 Politics is everything to liberal Democrats , because government power is everything to them . 
1	212	" ( 9 ) Perhaps the worst of the Big Lies was "" if you like your doctor , you can keep your doctor , "" designed to give liberal Democrat government absolute life - and - death power over all citizens through the enactment of Obamacare . "
1	212	 What better way to achieve totalitarian rule than mortal power over all the ruled people ? 
1	212	 See why socialized medicine is the liberal Democrats ' Holy Grail ? 
1	212	 A broader explanation for the liberal Democrats ' current hysteria : Their camp had some very sinister plans for the country , and was oh - so - close to ultimate success . 
1	212	 With the election of President Hillary Clinton , a prospective second straight subversive in the office , Democrats could have finally amnestied 11 million illegal aliens , i.e. , new Democrat voters , thereby ensuring that no Republican could ever again be elected president . 
1	212	 This outcome would establish their goal of a one - party dictatorship , in effect―if only it had happened . 
1	212	 The dream scenario having been snatched away is what has driven the liberal Democrats over the edge . 
1	212	 So , in their delirium , they lash out . 
1	212	 It is all understandable for a group of closet totalitarians in the throes of catastrophic disappointment . 
1	212	 And if they tear the nation apart as they act out , so much the better , in their warped view . 
1	212	 They always despised the country anyway . 
1	212	 Now the plan is for arch - socialist Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren ( who misrepresented her own race for financial gain ) , to win the presidency in 2020 for a slightly postponed takeover . 
1	212	 Pleasant dreams , America . 
1	212	 There is something happening here . 
1	212	 John Gaski is an associate professor at the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame . 
1	212	 He is a long - time registered Democrat and long - time registered Republican — intermittently , not simultaneously .
