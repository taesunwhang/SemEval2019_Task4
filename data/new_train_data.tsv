1	0	 Liberals Bash FBI Director Comey Over Clinton Probe After Praising Him in July 
1	0	 Mother of Jailed Sailor : ' Hold Hillary to Same Standards ' as My Son on Classified Info 
1	0	 The FBI 's ability to get Huma Abedin- Hillary Clinton 's closest advisor , confidante and State Department deputy chief of staff - to sing will make or break this election . 
1	0	 Right now , reports are the FBI is negotiating with Huma 's lawyers , stemming from her joint computer with pervert husband , disgraced ex -congressman Anthony Weiner . 
1	0	 Here we go again : We are nine days from an election that will redefine this nation . 
1	0	 And as I said last night , we 're on the precipice of yet another constitutional crisis because of the Clintons . 
1	0	 This time , involving an alleged pedophile , our nation 's top secrets and a couple of grifters from Arkansas . 
1	0	 You already know how I feel about all this from my open last night . 
1	0	 The American people are entitled to know before we go to the voting booth what it was that caused FBI Director Comey to reopen the case . 
1	0	 He 's got to tell us what was discovered what was so big that he violated Justice Department and FBI guidelines and alerted the nation . 
1	0	 He can not hide behind protocol . 
1	0	 The Justice guidelines ' do n't let me talk ' rule does n't work anymore . 
1	0	 The ' we do n't comment on pending cases ' does n't work anymore . 
1	0	 There are no ethical prohibitions . 
1	0	 You have been invited by the target and her surrogates to release the information that caused you to reopen a closed case . 
1	0	 If there is an indictment , Hillary is now foreclosed from objecting to such disclosure . 
1	0	 My bet is , she knows you wo nt - but thinks that she 's calling your bluff . 
1	0	 If she really wanted to know , all she has to do is sit down with Huma and ask her . 
1	0	 The investigation is then not compromised , since documentary evidence - here emails - do not change . 
1	0	 So it 's time to do what you did n't do last year- a thorough unbiased investigation , using all the tools available search warrants and empaneling a grand jury . 
1	0	 No more mother may I routine . 
1	0	 You 're the one who got yourself in this mess . 
1	0	 And now the American people are in a bigger mess . 
1	0	 In 2013 Huma signed a document under penalty of perjury when she left the state department that she had turned over all classified materials and that she was not retaining copies . 
1	0	 It seems that metadata on 650 thousand emails suggest otherwise . 
1	0	 Huma swore under oath that she searched thru all her devices for anything state related . 
1	0	 She had a chance to turn things over and she did n't . 
1	0	 Start your negotiation there , Mr. Director . 
1	0	 You 've got her in a corner . 
1	0	 It 's time to throw some punches . 
1	0	 Make your deal with Huma now . 
1	0	 If you do n't and Hillary gets elected , no one will care . 
1	0	 Hillary will do what she 's always done . 
1	0	 She 'll be appalled at Huma . 
1	0	 She 'll say she did n't know . 
1	0	 She did n't remember . 
1	0	 She short - circuited . 
1	0	 She had a brain clot . 
1	0	 She had no idea . 
1	0	 Look , the American people are already traumatized by the Clinton scandals and we just ca n't take 4 more years of them . 
1	0	 Word is that although Justice told your FBI guys to shut down the Clinton Foundation investigation , it 's still ongoing . 
1	0	 The justice dept . 
1	0	 is dirty and you know it . 
1	0	 Our attorney general actually pleaded the fifth on the Iran ransom probe . 
1	0	 Loretta Lynch meeting with the spouse of a target and then the target herself days later saying I will keep Loretta Lynch as my attorney general is bribery pure and simple . 
1	0	 Jim , go back to your roots . 
1	0	 You were once a great prosecutor . 
1	0	 Do n't let Washington ruin you too . 
1	0	 You need to send these Clintons back to where they came from . 
1	0	 It 's time for you to buck up put on your big boy pants and make a deal with Huma for the sake of this nation . 
1	0	 You 've got till Tuesday .Fiery Judge Jeanine to Comey : ' Send These Clintons Back to Where They Came From '

0	3	A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit families of Pulse victims filed against several social media companies alleging they did n't do enough to stop ISIS propaganda that radicalized gunman Omar Mateen . 
0	3	 The order to dismiss the lawsuit was filed Friday , the same day a jury of 12 acquitted Mateen 's widow Noor Salman , who was charged with aiding and abetting a foreign terror organization and obstruction of justice . 
0	3	" Family members of nine victims and four survivors of the nightclub shooting sued Twitter , Facebook and Google on December 19 , 2016 , claiming that the online platforms "" aided and abetted "" and "" conspired "" with the Islamic State , an international terrorist organization , to commit the June 12 , 2016 attack . "
0	3	" The lawsuit alleged that the companies knew "" that ISIS members and its official news outlets use numerous accounts "" on the social media platforms to "" publish the organization 's messages and to recruit and ‘ radicalize ' persons such as Mateen . "" "
0	3	" They argued that because Mateen was able to access videos of beheadings and other "" jihadist material "" through their platforms , they contributed to his "" self - radicalization . "" "
0	3	 But the Michigan court ruled that the Orlando shooting was not directly committed by ISIS , nor did the companies do anything to support Mateen . 
0	3	" U.S. District Judge David M. Lawson wrote in his dismissal that there is no definitive evidence suggesting that the material Mateen saw online directly led to the attack , "" other than that the principles espoused in them motivated Mateen to carry out the dreadful act . "" "
0	3	" "" The only conduct involved with the attacks that is described with any particularity is Mateen 's , "" Lawson wrote , which suggests that he planned and conducted the shooting "" in isolation , when he ‘ self - radicalized ' by perusing Internet postings , and then acted on his self - informed radical sentiments . "" "
0	3	 During the Salman trial in Orlando , prosecutors released Mateen 's web activity in the weeks leading up to the attack , including Google and Twitter searches related to ISIS , terrorism , and FBI surveillance .

0	4	Last Sunday , a frightfully organized lone gunman opened fire on a crowd of 22,000 people at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas . 
0	4	 In his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel , he had 23 guns , some of which were outfitted with bump stocks ( devices which allow semi - automatic weapons the capability to mimic the gunfire of automatic weapons ) . 
0	4	 He killed 58 people and injured 527 before being discovered , killing himself before police could apprehend him . 
0	4	 In the wake of the worst mass shooting in modern United States history , the NRA CEO 's response to the Las Vegas shooting was defiant , belligerent , and utterly tone deaf . 
0	4	 Romper has reached out to the NRA and is awaiting a reply . 
0	4	 NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre , normally a man who keeps a low profile , offered a rare interview with Fox News on Thursday . 
0	4	" While he did call the Las Vegas shooting an "" unimaginable tragedy "" during his interview , LaPierre insisted that stricter gun laws would not change mass shootings : "
0	4	 If legislation worked , Boston massacre would n't have worked , San Bernardino where California has every gun law on the books , that would n't have happened . 
0	4	" LaPierre went on to quickly accuse the "" other side "" of the tragedy ; notably Democrats and celebrities who have been vehemently calling for gun control legislation . "
0	4	" The NRA CEO lashed out and accused them of trying to politicize a tragedy , and attempting "" to piggyback their whole agenda to ban guns , restrict law abiding people for the last 20 years , this circus , on the back of this tragedy . "" "
0	4	 The CEO became especially agitated when discussing what he believes to be the double standard coming out of Hollywood : 
0	4	 We spend millions of dollars every year , teaching people safety and responsibility , and this Hollywood crowd makes billions teaching gun irresponsibility to the American public . 
0	4	 The hypocrisy is beyond belief . 
0	4	 Of course , LaPierre does n't have actual facts to back up those claims , and it 's important to remember that he is talking about fictional depictions in action movies . 
0	4	" When LaPierre accused those unnamed "" Hollywood elites "" of "" protecting themselves with guns , "" while supposedly wanting to get rid of guns , he has clearly forgotten that few people who have weighed in on stricter gun control have not called for an outright ban of firearms , according to Salon . "
0	4	" His interview with Fox News ' Sean Hannity was terribly off the mark , focused on Hollywood , rather than the "" unimaginable tragedy "" he referenced at first and then appeared to quickly forget . "
0	4	 Movies in Hollywood do depict deaths , but not actual deaths caused by real guns . 
0	4	 Here are a few real - life statistics about gun use in America : 
0	4	 According to Vox , the United States fares poorly when compared to gun violence in countries of similar socio - economic success . 
0	4	 There are six times as many homicides by firearms in the United Statescompared to neighboring Canada , and 16 times as many as Germany . 
0	4	 Americans own nearly half of the civilian - owned firearmsin the world , according to CNN , 310 million of the 650 million civilian - owned firearms worldwide . 
0	4	 Americans own more guns per capita than any other country on the planet , according to a PEW Center study . 
0	4	 There are more public mass shootings in the United States than any other country in the world , according to the same study by the PEW Center . 
0	4	 However badly LaPierre would like to shift the focus from the Las Vegas shooting victims to his personal vendetta against Hollywood action films , it ca n't happen . 
0	4	 The reality is , the families of those victims need a real , informed , empathetic response to the mass shooting . 
0	4	 Not a distraction . 
0	4	 Because they are real people who lost real loved ones at the hands of a man with real guns . 
0	4	 This is n't a movie . 
0	4	 It 's real life .The NRA CEO 's Response To Las Vegas Shooting Was Incredibly Tone - Deaf
0	5	The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) is recommending to the Justice Department that no charges should be brought against Hillary Clinton for her use of private email servers as secretary of state , FBI Director James Comey announced Tuesday . 
0	5	" "" Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case , "" Comey said after detailing the FBI 's findings in its investigation of Clinton 's use of personal email servers . "" "
0	5	" No charges are appropriate in this case . "" "
0	5	 Comey announced that the FBI has completed its investigation of Clinton 's use of a personal email server and is now referring the matter to the Justice Department to decide whether to prosecute . 
0	5	 Comey made clear he did n't coordinate his statement with the Justice Department or any other part of the government . 
0	5	 The FBI assessed whether classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on Clinton 's personal email server or whether classified information was mishandled intentionally or in a grossly negligent way -- which is a felony -- or whether people knowingly removed classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities , which is a misdemeanor , Comey said . 
0	5	 He added that the FBI also investigated whether there was computer intrusion by nation states or hostile actors . 
0	5	" Comey said that the FBI found that Clinton actually used "" several different servers "" and administrators of those servers during her four years as secretary of state as well as "" numerous mobile devices "" to send and receive email on her personal domain . "
0	5	" When one of the servers was decommissioned in 2013 , the software was removed , but millions of email fragments remained in a "" slack space of the server "" which the FBI had to use to piece the puzzle of her emails back together . "
0	5	" "" We searched through all of it to understand what was there and what parts of the puzzle we could put back together again , "" Comey said . "
0	5	" From the group of approximately 30,000 emails that Clinton provided to the State Department , the FBI found 110 emails in 52 email chains that "" have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received , "" Comey said . "
0	5	 Eight of those chains contained top - secret information , Comey said , 36 chains contained information that was considered secret at the time and eight were considered confidential . 
0	5	" Comey said that the FBI "" found no evidence that any of the additional work - related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them in some way . "" "
0	5	" Therefore , Comey said the FBI has "" reasonable confidence "" that there was "" no intentional misconduct "" in connection to the sorting of Clinton 's emails . "
0	5	 The FBI director , however , slammed Clinton for her general use of the email server . 
0	5	" "" There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive , highly classified information , "" he said , adding that anyone in Clinton 's position or in the positions of people she communicated with "" should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation . "" "
0	5	" Comey said that the FBI did not find "" direct evidence "" that Clinton 's personal email domain was hacked successfully , but cautioned that the government is "" unlikely to find such direct evidence . "" "
0	5	" At the same time , he warned that "" hostile actors gained access "" to private email accounts with which Clinton was in regular contact . "
0	5	" He also said that because Clinton sent and received work emails in territories of sophisticated adversaries , Comey said , "" It is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton 's personal email account . "" "
0	5	 The conclusion of the investigation comes after Clinton met with FBI officials in Washington for three and a half hours Saturday about her use of the private email server she used while she was secretary of state , her campaign said . 
0	5	 Federal investigators also interviewed Clinton 's top aides , including Huma Abedin , who was questioned in April . 
0	5	 Clinton had turned over her email server to the FBI in August , and at the time she turned it over , it had been wiped clean . 
0	5	 In May , Clinton told CBS News that she expected a quick conclusion to the FBI probe into whether she mishandled classified information on her server , which Clinton used exclusively to send and receive State Department correspondence . 
0	5	" "" I always took classified material seriously , "" she told "" Face the Nation "" host John Dickerson . "" "
0	5	 There was never any material marked classified that was sent or received by me . 
0	5	" And I look forward to this being wrapped up . "" "
0	5	 There has been increased scrutiny of the Justice Department , which oversees the FBI , and Attorney General Loretta Lynch after she had a spontaneous half - hour - long meeting with former President Clinton early last week . 
0	5	" The attorney general said Friday of the meeting with Clinton that she "" certainly would n't do it again , "" a sentiment seconded by the former president and by Hillary Clinton , who told MSNBC in an interview that "" hindsight is 20 - 20 . "" "
0	5	 Lynch confirmed Friday that she would be accepting the recommendations of the career prosecutors in the email case , though she stopped short of formally recusing herself from the matter . 
0	5	 CBS News ' Paula Reid contributed to this report .FBI : No charges against Hillary Clinton are appropriate for email server use
1	6	After Colin Kaepernick rightly chose to kneel during the national anthem before NFL games , many racists and idiots came out with critical response to what was a peaceful , important statement against police brutality and systemic American racism .

1	6	 Many of them fight for Kaepernick 's right to stand down during the national anthem . 
1	6	 You want to shit on those troops too ?

1	6	 He kneels at left . 
1	6	" Hat off to Tunsil for this action . "" "
1	6	" Respecting the flag "" and "" respecting the anthem "" before football games are perhaps the dumbest notions floated among sports fans . "

0	7	 While Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton will represent the entire country , the Americans who selected them are a small part of it . 
0	7	 The United States is home to 324 million people . 
0	7	 Each square here represents 1 million people . 
0	7	 103 million of them are children , noncitizens or ineligible felons , and they do not have the right to vote .

0	7	 A small percentage of people vote in primaries but not in general elections , and they are also not included . 
0	7	 The remaining 60 million people voted in the primaries : about 30 million each for Republicans and Democrats . 
0	7	 But half of the primary voters chose other candidates . 
0	7	 Just 14 percent of eligible adults — 9 percent of the whole nation — voted for either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton .

0	8	brightcove.createExperiences ( ) ; Donald Trump is one step closer to securing the Republican nomination for president . 
0	8	 Following Tuesday night 's primary in Indiana , the GOP front - runner was named the presumptive nominee after Texas Senator Ted Cruz announced that he was suspending his campaign . 
0	8	" "" Donald Trump will be presumptive GOP nominee , we all need to unite and focus on defeating @HillaryClinton # NeverClinton , "" Republican Party chairman Reince Priebus tweeted . "
0	8	" Although , Trump and Cruz were far from cordial opponents throughout the race , the billionaire businessman said what Cruz did was a "" brave thing to do because we want to bring unity . "" "
0	8	" While Cruz revealed he was leaving the race as there no longer seemed to be a "" viable "" path to the White House , Ohio Governor John Kasich has not announced the end of his campaign . "
0	8	 However , even with Kasich still in the race , Trump sits in a comfortable position to officially take the nomination if he secures the required 1,237 delegates needed to win his party . 
0	8	" "" Tonight 's results are not going to alter Gov. Kasich 's campaign plans , "" Kasich 's chief strategist John Weaver said , according to CNN . "" "
0	8	" Our strategy has been and continues to be one that involves winning the nomination at an open convention . "" "
0	8	 While Kasich 's camp continues to be optimistic , Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton‘s campaign - which also took a blow to her campaign when Senator Bernie Sanders won Indiana - released a statement , condemning the announcement that Trump is the Republican party 's presumptive nominee . 
0	8	" "" Fundamentally , our next president will need to do two things : keep our nation safe in a dangerous world and help working families get ahead here at home , "" the statement , obtained by PEOPLE , read . "" "
0	8	 Donald Trump is not prepared to do either . 
0	8	 Throughout his campaign , Donald Trump has demonstrated that he 's too divisive and lacks the temperament to lead our nation and the free world . 
0	8	" "" With so much as stake , Donald Trump is simply too big of a risk . "
0	8	 Hillary Clinton has proven that she has the strength to keep us safe in an uncertain world and a lifelong record of fighting to break down the barriers - economic and social - that hold working families back . 
0	8	" While Donald Trump seeks to bully and divide Americans , Hillary Clinton will unite us to create an economy that works for everyone . "" "
0	8	" While Trump ignored any criticism , saying during his victory speech at Trump tower , "" We 're going to win in November "" , he faced backlash from another opponent in the form anti - Trump adds that the Progressive Change Campaign Committee has released in an accelerated campaign against Trump . "
0	8	" According to a press release from the PCCC , the ads will highlight Trump 's "" hate - mongering , his disrespect for women , and his belief that American wages are ‘ too high ' . "" "
0	8	" "" We have already begun running ads across the nation hitting Donald Trump - defining him early and moving the debate to our turf . "

1	9	By : Jon Rappoport / Activist Post I was shocked , but not surprised , by the relatively small number of independent news sites that came to Mike 's defense . 
1	9	 Has the 1st Amendment become a faded memory ? 
1	9	 For six days , Google shut down all listings for Natural News . 
1	9	 Google gave no rational explanation . 
1	9	 Then , again with no comprehensible reason , Google restored Natural News . 
1	9	 To say this behavior was deranged would be a vast understatement . 
1	9	 It 's possible that the outpouring of protests after the takedown threw Google back on their heels , and they gave in . 
1	9	 But the game is not over . 
1	9	 Google could go off on another witch hunt . 
1	9	 They 've proved they 're quite capable of it . 
1	9	" The Natural News debacle stems , in part , from the absurd war against "" fake news . "" "
1	9	 Major media , the prime - cut purveyors of fake news , launched the war after they were left with egg on their faces in the wake of the presidential election . 
1	9	 They had to find scapegoats . 
1	9	 They had to explain their failure to predict the winner . 
1	9	 They had to explain why they overtly supported Hillary Clinton throughout the campaign . 
1	9	 They had to do something , anything , in order to deflect blame and derision . 
1	9	 So the Russia - Trump - WikiLeaks - fake news narrative was launched out of the crypts of the Washington Post , New York Times , and other big - time echo chambers . 
1	9	 Natural News was placed in the crosshairs and assailed as a pro - Trump fake news site . 
1	9	 We should n't overlook the fact , as well , that Mike has carried out a highly successful and devastating attack on the medical cartel for years . 
1	9	" So - called "" science blogs "" have been after him , hammer and tongs . "
1	9	" Mike writes : "" After six days of being blacklisted by Google , the NaturalNews.com website has been restored to Google 's search results . "
1	9	" The action by Google follows the largest and most vocal backlash against Google 's de - listing of any website in the history of the company [ Google ] , and it has sparked many new discussions and debates about search engines , censorship and free speech . "" "
1	9	" "" For the record , there was never any allegation or evidence that Natural News had intentionally violated Google 's webmaster guidelines . "
1	9	" While Google said we were being flagged for a so - called "" sneaky mobile redirect "" on a very small number of pages in a subdomain ( blogs.naturalnews.com ) which were created by outside bloggers , Google went to the extraordinary step of banning the entire NaturalNews.com root domain and all its subdomains — a step that would never have been applied to CNN , Huffington Post or other popular news websites . "
1	9	" In fact , a Natural News investigation showed that violations identified involving websites like HuffPo , Forbes and CNN did not result in the same kind of blacklisting that was applied to Natural News . "" "
1	9	" "" Furthermore , while Google did make an effort to provide us with one URL that they said flagged this mobile redirect , to date there has n't been a single SEO expert or engineer who could reproduce the supposed redirect issue . "" "
1	9	" "" Even more disturbingly , when we went to the Google product webmaster forum to ask for help identifying this issue , we were insulted , mocked and accused of lying by Google 's supporters who behaved like a pack of jackals rather than search engine professionals . "" "
1	9	" "" Through this entire process , Natural News was constantly being called a liar for failing to remove something that Google flatly refused to identify . "
1	9	" In essence , we were charged with a ‘ crime ' by Google , yet Google refused to provide any details of the crime , nor any evidence of the crime , nor any tool whereby we could reproduce Google 's claimed ‘ redirect ' . "" "
1	9	" "" To call this process extremely frustrating for webmasters is an understatement . "
1	9	 I continue to believe that Natural News was targeted by Google due to the content of our speech which supports President Trump … and that the ‘ sneaky mobile redirects ' issue was merely the justification used by Google to de - list the entire NaturalNews.com website . 
1	9	 Google no doubt disagrees with this assessment and says it was just a technical issue , yet we are not aware of any other situation in which a minor technical issue on a subdomain resulted in Google blacklisting the entire ROOT domain of a major publisher , with 140,000 + pages of quality content .

1	9	 Many independent news sites decided to ignore Google 's censorship of Mike and Natural News . 
1	9	 They , too , failed to establish a firm defense of free speech . 
1	9	 Some of these independent sites , knowing what Natural News has done to attack conventional medicine and the medical cartel , decided to stand back and remain silent , because they consider medical information a holy of holies . 
1	9	 They will attack major media on many issues , but The Medical is n't one of them .

1	10	Despite being around for more than a century , suppressors are n't really used in crimes . 
1	10	 In fact , it seems like the only time you see a crime committed with a suppressor , it 's where having the suppressor itself is illegal for whatever reason . 
1	10	 They 're just not used that way very often . 
1	10	 However , if the Hearing Protection Act passes as part of the SHARE Act , suppressors will likely become far more common . 
1	10	 That has the hysterical tribe at The Trace worried about criminals getting their grubby little paws on them via theft . 
1	10	 Congress could vote as soon as this week to repeal part of an 80-year - old law that has forced owners of silencers to register the devices with the federal government . 
1	10	 Supporters of removing restrictions on silencers have dismissed the concerns of opponents by pointing out that suppressors , as they 're also known , are today rarely used in crimes . 
1	10	 The more pertinent public safety question , however , is what could happen if many more silencers enter circulation . 
1	10	 Even with the hurdles that silencer buyers must deal with , demand for the items is already increasing , fueled by a new generation of suppressors and some slick marketing . 
1	10	 There are now more that 1.3 million of them registered with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , up from about 360,000 just five years ago . 
1	10	 There 's also evidence to suggest that as silencers have gained a foothold with gun owners , some are winding up in the black market . 
1	10	 We 've written before that as goes the legal gun industry , so goes the criminal arsenal . 
1	10	 Firearms and related tools like extended magazines that are initially sold legally end up in criminals ' hands in several ways : unregulated private transactions , straw purchases and , of course , theft . 
1	10	 To be sure , theft is a legitimate concern . 
1	10	 It 's impossible to keep things out of criminals ' hands because they 're often acquired via theft , either directly or indirectly on the black market . 
1	10	 I 'd like to applaud The Trace for at least acknowledging that criminals are unlikely to walk into a gun store and buy suppressors . 
1	10	 Good for them . 
1	10	 Make no mistake , criminals will get their hands on suppressors via theft . 
1	10	 It 's going to happen , unfortunately . 
1	10	 Of course , criminals can make suppressors in their garage right now . 
1	10	 All the information is on the internet for anyone and their brother to look at if they so choose . 
1	10	 It 's been that way for years . 
1	10	 Yet they 're still rarely used in crime . 
1	10	 Why is that ? 
1	10	 Take a look at this photo of a suppressed pistol , since handguns are the preferred weapon of the average criminal . 
1	10	 Note that the suppressor extends well beyond the weapon . 
1	10	 In fact , it doubles the overall length of the weapon . 
1	10	 Guess what this does ? 
1	10	 It makes it very , very difficult to hide a suppressed firearm . 
1	10	 Seriously , try tucking one of those in the front of your pants sometime and see how quickly you draw . 
1	10	 This makes suppressors very difficult to sneak into a convenience store . 
1	10	 It 's also difficult to mill about waiting for someone to pull the gun on and rob . 
1	10	" While criminals will , no doubt , get their hands on suppressors in the course of their "" career , "" it wo n't really help them much . "
1	10	 They 're terrible options for their line of work , and with the internet 's instructions laying the mysteries of the suppressor bare years ago , there 's no reason to fear them getting into any crooks hands . 
1	10	 They 're likely already there , and they figure out quickly they 're useless for their purposes .Why Criminals Stealing Suppressors Is n't The Problem Some Anti - Gunners Think
1	11	 If we measured political ability by a person 's capacity to say laughable talking points with a straight face , Susan Rice has to be the politician of the century .  
1	11	 Susan Rice has a unique gift to make the news every time she speaks . 
1	11	 Instead of looking in the mirror and considering her ill - advised statements about the cause of terrorism and a deserter 's supposedly meritorious record , this time she blames the backlash on the intersection of race and gender . 
1	11	 In short , she claims she is being attacked because she is a black woman . 
1	11	 In reality , she is being attacked because she is a ridiculous partisan hack , whose disconnect from basic facts and ability to repeat the most ridiculous spin and talking points from the Obama administration is as ridiculous as it is stunning . 
1	11	 If we measured political ability by a person 's capacity to say laughable talking points with a straight face , Susan Rice has to be the politician of the century . 
1	11	 She first made the news when she commented on the 2012 attacks in Libya that killed the US ambassador and 3 other Americans . 
1	11	 Hillary Clinton 's State Department emails ( the ones that were n't illegally deleted of course ) , revealed that she told multiple people almost immediately that the events in Libya were terrorist attacks . 
1	11	 But in public , Susan Rice went on five Sunday talk shows to claim they attacked in response to a video even though it was plainly obvious to anybody watching that there was more to the attack than a video . 
1	11	 The next time she resurfaced she tried to defend Bowe Bergdahl , an army soldier captured by the Taliban . 
1	11	 When the Obama administration secured his release Susan Rice again went on morning talk shows . 
1	11	" This time she said he served with "" honor and distinction . "" "
1	11	 But this was completely outrageous because most of his comrades said he defected to the enemy and the army court martialed him for desertion . 
1	11	 The trade also sparked a significant debate over the wisdom in trading one ( subpar ) soldier for five terrorists . 
1	11	 Now she has resurfaced again . 
1	11	 Her name has entered the conversation in regards to the so - called Russian hacking of the election . 
1	11	 Among all of the arguing , Susan Rice admitted to being one of the individuals that unmasked figures in the Trump campaign . 
1	11	 Unlike the hysteria over little more than innuendo linking the Trump campaign with Russia , unmasking can be a serious crime . 
1	11	 As a result she has been the subject of intense disagreement and scrutiny . 
1	11	 Despite regularly sticking her foot in her mouth and repeating talking points that have tenuous connections to reality , she now blames much of the backlash on racism and sexism . 
1	11	 An independent prosecutor will investigate the matter and all related issues . 
1	11	 Until then , I 'm marveling at the utter ineptness of Susan Rice . 
1	11	 She supplies so many howling and guffaw inducing talking points but does it with such sincerity and a straight face that I almost wish she would be in the news every day . 
1	11	 To have a partisan hack that is willing to spy on their political enemies and fall on their sword must be important for Obama and Clinton . 
1	11	 But she also supplies her own daggers every time she speaks .Susan Rice is a Gaffe Machine , but Blames the Hate on Racist and Sexist Republicans
1	12	Junkbunny Who Tried Buying Xanax Off Turtleboy Tried Suing EMT After She Came After Him On An Ambulance Ride And Has Declared War On Turtle Riders 
1	12	 Want to advertise with Turtleboy ? 
1	12	 Email us at Turtleboysports@gmail.com for more information . 
1	12	 For the first time ever today two junkboxes messaged the Turtleboy business page to ask if we had Xanax for sale . 
1	12	 One of them was Jessica Kane , who according to her Facebook page lives in Pawtucket , but she insists she lives in Smithfield , RI . 
1	12	 Odds are she knows her way around the Bucket though , and could probably tell you which corners yield the highest dividends . 
1	12	 Just sayin . 
1	12	 Anyway , she reached out to us looking for zannies : 
1	12	 But Jessica Kane was just warming up . 
1	12	 Because it was n't enough to message a blog that frequently shames junkboxes and ratchets , looking for drugs , she had to take on turtle riders too … … . 
1	12	" "" I 'll beat ur ass corn . "" "
1	12	 That 's a new one . 
1	12	 As you can see she is alleging that we are the ones who solicited her to see if she wanted to buy drugs off us . 
1	12	 Ya got that ? 
1	12	 This is what Turtleboys do every day . 
1	12	 We scour the Internet looking for junkboxes to sell our excess zannies to . 
1	12	 Definitely . 
1	12	" Anyway , turns out she does n't have a drug problem , her "" job "" just does n't offer health insurance . "
1	12	 Naturally then her only recourse was to message Turtleboy and see what he was charging . 
1	12	 She ca n't afford health insurance , but cash money sure ai n't a problem : 
1	12	 That right there is a lot of mushroom tip participation trophies ! ! 
1	12	 As you can see , she 's sticking to her story that we messaged her first , which obviously makes TONS of sense . 
1	12	 She kept posting a screenshot showing what appears to be us contacting her first , asking if she was looking for zannies . 
1	12	 She just forgot that in the very blog she was commenting on anyone could clearly see that she was the one who initiated contact : 
1	12	 Oops ! ! 
1	12	 After that it was time to bust out the CAPS LOCK ! ! 
1	12	 Thirteen years is a long time to be prescribed Xanax . 
1	12	" And by "" prescribed "" she means , "" treated Diego to a basket lunch in exchange for illegal narcotics . "" "
1	12	" Up next was the "" I 'll fuck everyone up "" portion of the Gospel of Ratchet : "
1	12	 Yea guys , she 's totally not a junkie . 
1	12	 She just so happens to message random community Facebook pages looking to score drugs . 
1	12	 And occasionally she gets busted with crack cocaine : 
1	12	 Besides that she 's totally NOT a junkie . 
1	12	 But it 's all good in the hood because she got that shit dismissed ! ! 
1	12	 Therefore she never got caught with crack cocaine . ( 
1	12	 P.S. turtle riders are savage ) 
1	12	 Next up in the ratchet script was the threat to call the cops : 
1	12	 So if you 're keeping score at home , this woman approached us about buying drugs , admitted to the cops that she did so , and the cops responded by turning their focus on cyberbullying . 
1	12	 Because NOTHING IS MORE SERIOUS THAN CYBERBULLYING , EVEN ADDICTION ! ! 
1	12	 You ca n't make this stuff up . 
1	12	 Only on Turtleboy . 
1	12	 This is why we are the greatest blog that 's ever existed . 
1	12	 Good luck finding this sort of entertainment at Barstool . 
1	12	 But her story checks out because her uncle is the chief of police : 
1	12	 We just do n't know what town he 's the chief of police in . 
1	12	 Wherever he is , I 'm sure her imaginary uncle would be thrilled to find his junkie niece name dropping him on Turtleboy . 
1	12	 But wait , it gets better . 
1	12	 Last year she made headlines when she was getting her biweekly free ambulance ride to the ER when she claimed she was abused by one of the first responders . 
1	12	" And in one of the greatest MSM fails of all time , NCB "" Investigative "" Team fell for her act hook , line , and sinker : "
1	12	 That interview was amazing . 
1	12	" She literally puts on a blazer and some non - prescription glasses and the schmucks on this "" I - Team "" just assume she 's a law - abiding non - ratchet member of society . "
1	12	 A local woman turned to the NBC 10 I - Team for answers after she captured a confrontation inside a North Providence ambulance on cell phone video . 
1	12	 The video shows an EMT lashing out at her , appearing to slap her in the face and swearing at her several times . 
1	12	" "" He then smacked me across my face , "" Jessica Kane said of the July 30 incident . "
1	12	 North Providence officers were responding to a domestic disturbance call when they came into contact with Kane , who is epileptic . 
1	12	 A police report obtained by NBC 10 shows the officers saw her have a seizure and lose consciousness . 
1	12	 They called the North Providence Fire Department for medical aid , and an ambulance arrived a short time later . 
1	12	" "" As soon as I was put into the rescue , I was called a drug addict , which I am not , "" she said . "" "
1	12	 I was just belittled so much . 
1	12	" It made me feel like the people here to treat me were there to just accuse me . "" "
1	12	 Oh yea , she 's TOTALLY not a drug addict . 
1	12	 She 's just been arrested for crack cocaine and messages random Facebook pages with 99,000 followers to see if they can sell her Xanax . 
1	12	" Oh , and her raspy "" life kicked the shit out of me and I 'm only 26 "" voice was n't a dead giveaway or anything like that . "
1	12	 The video shows the EMT appear to slap Kane in the face , causing her to drop her phone . 
1	12	" "" That 's assault ! "" "
1	12	 she screams on the tape . 
1	12	" "" I 'll give you assault ! "" "
1	12	 the man responds . 
1	12	 Watch the video if you have n't already . 
1	12	 She 's all fucked up and aggressive and is taping the guy who probably knows her middle name , date of birth , and blood type because he deals with her so often . 
1	12	 She wo n't shut the fuck up and approaches him while taping . 
1	12	 She gets too close . 
1	12	 He pushes her away from him . 
1	12	 Assault . 
1	12	" That 's how stupid the NBC 10 "" I - Team "" is . "
1	12	" The unidentified EMT can also be heard telling Kane to "" shut the ( expletive ) up . "" "
1	12	" She said the verbal abuse continued once she arrived at the hospital , moments not captured in the video . "" "
1	12	" He said , ‘ If you do n't get the F up off this stretcher , I 'm going to rip you by your hair , ' "" Kane told NBC 10 . "
1	12	 Funny that none of that is on the tape . 
1	12	 Guess we 'll just have to take this crackbunny 's word for it . 
1	12	 NBC 10 also reviewed the police report from officers who arrived that day . 
1	12	" They noted that Kane was difficult to deal with , writing that , "" Jessica was yelling and screaming in the middle of the road "" and was "" extremely belligerent . "" "
1	12	" The police report continues , saying that Kane "" became hostile , trying to unbuckle herself and get off the stretcher . "" "
1	12	 Boom . 
1	12	 Mystery solved . 
1	12	 Kane was released after spending about five hours at Fatima Hospital , and her cell phone was returned . 
1	12	" That 's when she said she found the video she recorded in the ambulance in her iPhone 's "" Recently Deleted "" folder . "
1	12	" She believes someone tried to erase it while the phone was out of her control . "" "
1	12	" I actually received my phone back and I saw that they tried to delete the video , "" she said . "
1	12	 Oh yea , I 'm sure that 's what happened . 
1	12	 Why would she lie ? 
1	12	 She 's wearing a blazer and glasses ! ! 
1	12	 Kane hired an attorney and said she plans to file an assault complaint with Rhode Island State Police . 
1	12	 As of Wednesday , state police said they had not yet received the complaint or been contacted by Kane about the incident . 
1	12	 Translation - she called up Dick N. Vulva , never paid him , got high , and never followed through with her massive lawsuit . 
1	12	 Anyway , we were still confused how the hell Jessica Kane got the impression that we were zanny salesmen . 
1	12	 Turns out there was a whole background story : 
1	12	 You ca n't make this shit up . 
1	12	 In August we blogged about this Lawrence ghettopoon selling Xanax on Facebook : 
1	12	 Evidently Jessica Kane read the headline of this blog , assumed that we were the ones selling zannies , waited until she got her check on the first of the month , and then hit us up for the hookup . 
1	12	 Just another day at Turtleboy . 
1	12	 Shit like this never gets old . 
1	12	 I love my job way too much . 
1	12	 One guy suggested that it was a slow week : 
1	12	 Dude , not one , but two junkbunnies messaged us assuming we sell Xanax from our Facebook page . 
1	12	 If you do n't think that 's getting blogged about then you do n't know Turtleboy . 
1	12	 Exactly ! ! 
1	12	 Someone gets it ! 
1	12	 From now on I think this is what you people should start doing : 
1	12	 Brilliant . 
1	12	 This could be a weekly segment . 
1	12	 We urge you to support the following local businesses .

1	14	Briefly : In our opinion , full ( 150 % of the regular full position ) speculative short positions in gold , silver and mining stocks are justified from the risk / reward perspective at the moment of publishing this alert . 
1	14	 Gold moved back and forth on Friday and the accompanying volume was high , but that 's not the only important thing that we can discuss today . 
1	14	 The week is over and we have weekly changes and weekly volume levels to analyze and we saw major moves in the important ratios . 
1	14	 Additionally , we discovered a self - similar pattern in gold that has critical and volatile implications going forward . 
1	14	 Let 's start with Friday 's session and the changes in the gold market ( chart courtesy of http://stockcharts.com ) . 
1	14	 Gold moved sharply back and forth as both positive and negative data was released and ultimately it ended the session a few dollars higher ( based on kitco 's prices , the closing price was $ 1,279.60 ) . 
1	14	 Why was the reaction so significant ? 
1	14	 The reason could be technical - the apex of the triangle was likely to be accompanied by a turnaround and since we just saw a more visible top a couple of days ago and apparently gold does n't want to form a bottom here , then the only remaining outcome is a local daily top that does n't change much - which is what we saw . 
1	14	 Why do we think that gold does n't want to bottom here ? 
1	14	 Because if it did , it would have ended Friday 's session much higher . 
1	14	 The USD Index moved lower , so gold had a good reason to close the session visibly higher , especially that it moved quite high on an intraday basis . 
1	14	 Yet , it declined before the session was over and closed only insignificantly higher . 
1	14	" If gold does n't want to move higher , then silver must really hate that "" thought "" . "
1	14	 The white metal declined once again and even though gold closed a bit higher , it managed to close lower . 
1	14	 The move lower by itself is already bearish as it took place on visible volume , but it 's very bearish once we take into account Thursday 's breakdown . 
1	14	 We previously commented on it in the following way : 
1	14	 Silver declined and it reversed before the end of the session , which appears to be a reversal . 
1	14	 But does this reversal really have bullish implications ? 
1	14	 It does n't seem to be the case . 
1	14	 The volume was n't huge enough to confirm the reversal and it was not low enough to invalidate the bearish implications of the decline either . 
1	14	 The key thing to the proper analysis of the silver price swing is the awareness of what the USD and S&P 500 did . 
1	14	 The former declined a bit , while stocks truly soared , which created perfect circumstances for a silver rally . 
1	14	 Yet , instead of a rally , we saw a decline and a move below the rising support line based on the August and October lows . 
1	14	 Consequently , silver 's action was very bearish as it showed great weakness in this market . 
1	14	 Moreover , the mentioned support line could be viewed as a neck level of a head and shoulders pattern ( with a rather long right shoulder , similar to the one that we saw in the euro ) , which serves as an additional bearish indication ( it 's only a small addition to the bearish implications of the breakdown as such , as its implications are bearish regardless of the H&S formation being in place or not ) . 
1	14	 On Friday , the general stock market declined significantly but almost the entire decline was reversed before the end of the session . 
1	14	 If we consider Thursday and Friday together , the S&P 500 index still rallied considerably , but silver declined and was unable to invalidate its breakdown . 
1	14	 The implications are strongly bearish . 
1	14	 Let 's move back to gold for a few minutes . 
1	14	 In Friday 's alert , we wrote the following regarding the above chart featuring gold priced in the euro : 
1	14	 In terms of the euro , the bearish signals are much more profound . 
1	14	 Gold has just broken below the rising , medium - term support line and the most recent local top was formed approximately at the apex of the triangle pattern ( in terms of time ) . 
1	14	 The latter makes it considerably more likely that an important top was just formed and thus that the breakdown that we just saw will be confirmed . 
1	14	 As far as the apex of the triangle is concerned , it 's actually a combination of two such patterns - they are based on the same tops and bottoms , but in one case ( red lines ) they are based on the intraday extremes and in the other case ( black lines ) they are based on the daily closing prices . 
1	14	 The most recent top took place right between the apexes created based on both patterns . 
1	14	 The mentioned breakdown is almost confirmed . 
1	14	 Almost , because we would prefer to see three consecutive closing prices below the support line to see it as strong resistance , but we have already seen two of them , a weekly close and also a failed attempt to move back above the line . 
1	14	 The breakdown is very close to being fully confirmed and the bearishness of the implications increased significantly based on Friday 's session . 
1	14	 Speaking of breakdowns , we saw one in the gold to S&P 500 ratio , which … is nothing new , but still quite exciting and important . 
1	14	 Why ? 
1	14	 Because due to several failed attempts to break below this level , we had to be skeptical toward the breakdown this time . 
1	14	" The question was : "" Would this time be any different ? "" "
1	14	 It turned out that this time was different as the ratio moved back to the previously broken level , verified it as support and then continued to move lower on huge volume ( precisely , the ratio itself does n't have volume , so what we mean is the ratio of volumes ) . 
1	14	 Why would the above be a big deal ? 
1	14	 Because this ratio moves in tune with gold when it comes to major price moves and - more importantly - there was only one similar case in the past 15 years when we saw a similar breakdown and it was in the early stages of the 2012 - 2013 decline . 
1	14	 Back then , it was a warning sign that practically nobody noticed . 
1	14	 You 'll probably not see it anywhere ( except for this publication ) this time either . 
1	14	 Naturally , the implications are strongly bearish as the breakdown now appears believable . 
1	14	 Mining stocks , just like gold moved back and forth and ended the session higher , however , the move was too tiny in terms of daily closing prices to be viewed as bullish . 
1	14	 It 's more of a big - volume reversal and the implications thereof are bearish . 
1	14	 From the weekly point of view , we see that mining stocks declined and broke below the rising support lines based on the 2016 and 2017 lows and that the breakdown took place on big volume . 
1	14	 All that happened after two weeks of low - volume upswings that we commented on in last Monday 's alert : 
1	14	 Finally , the weekly volume levels in the GDX ETF paint a very bearish picture for the following weeks . 
1	14	 The GDX ETF is after 2 small , weekly rallies that were accompanied by very low volume when compared with the previous weeks . 
1	14	 The last week had less trading days , but that does n't explain the previous week 's low volume reading . 
1	14	 Moreover , we did n't see similarly low volume readings in the past Novembers , which suggests that we are correct to view the low volume levels as something important and meaningful . 
1	14	 The only comparable situation from the recent past took place in mid-2014 ( marked with a black arrow ) . 
1	14	 In the following weeks , the GDX price was cut by a third . 
1	14	 The bearish implications of the above just became more bearish as back in 2014 , the first big - volume weekly decline meant that the big slide had just begun . 
1	14	 The breakdown can also be seen in the case of the HUI to S&P 500 index ratio . 
1	14	 In other words , by looking at gold stocks ' performance relative to other stocks . 
1	14	 The breakdown is clear and confirmed by both weekly and monthly closing prices . 
1	14	 The implications are bearish . 
1	14	 All in all , the medium - term outlook is clearly bearish based on the above and based on the factors that we discussed previously and it seems that we 've been correct to be holding the short positions in metals and miners ( especially in silver and miners ) . 
1	14	 Still , it seems that the vast majority of the potential that these positions have is still to be realized . 
1	14	 This is particularly the case given the similarities between what we 're seeing now and what we saw before the previous slides . 
1	14	 We already discussed some of those similarities above , but there 's also something else that is likely in play right now . 
1	14	 In early October , we described the analogy in performance between 2008 and the current period ( at the moment ) in gold stocks . 
1	14	 It was almost two months ago , so even if you read it at that time , it might be worth reading it once again today ( by the way , we are making that alert available publicly , so if you know someone who 's interested in precious metals , but has doubts about using technical analysis to analyze it , please send them the link to that alert - they might change their minds - https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/gold-trading/the-more-things-change-the-more-they-stay-the-same/ ) - it 's truly amazing how the similarity continued almost to the letter even though the two cases are almost a decade apart . 
1	14	 Even the initial retracement of the HUI Index ( 38.2 % ) was identical . 
1	14	 However , today we are not going to repeat the October analysis - we are going to discuss something alike … in gold . 
1	14	 That 's right , the gold market features similarities to its performance back in 2008 . 
1	14	 Before moving to details , let 's state that the analogy is far from perfect . 
1	14	 That 's probably why we did n't discover it earlier . 
1	14	 However , it 's not the point to be picky about a technique , but rather to see if there is anything that it can give us and make us particularly aware of things that could come . 
1	14	 With regard to the latter goal in mind , it seems that we have something very valuable . 
1	14	 In both cases , we have a sharp rally that preceded a top , then we saw some kind of consolidation and another attempt to move higher , which failed ( mid-2008 and second half of 2012 ) and started a decline . 
1	14	 The decline was more or less twice the size of the decline from the key ( March 2008 and late 2011 ) top . 
1	14	 In 2008 , we saw a corrective upswing that was followed by a move to almost the final bottom and from mid-2013 to early 2015 we saw several such corrective upswings . 
1	14	 After the initial bottom ( September 2008 and the final part of 2015 ) gold soared sharply . 
1	14	 The sizes of the upswings differ on a relative basis , but it 's understandable as back in 2008 the moves took place in a very short time , so the levels of emotionality among market participants were much higher . 
1	14	 After the sharp rally , gold consolidated a bit ( late September 2008 and mid-2016 ) , then declined and moved close to the previous highs once again ( October 2008 and September 2017 ) . 
1	14	 The decline that started thereafter in 2008 was the biggest and sharpest decline in many years . 
1	14	 Naturally , this does not bode well for the near - term gold outlook . 
1	14	 Conversely , it seems that we can expect the most important part of the decline to be just around the corner . 
1	14	 The above implication is not the only interesting thing about the analogy , though . 
1	14	 The detail that could be important going forward is the moment when the decline took a breather . 
1	14	 At this time , the moves take more time , so the pauses could be longer and more visible as well and if we get enough bullish confirmations once gold moves to certain price levels , we might even adjust the trading position temporarily . 
1	14	 In 2008 , the first interim pause was at the most recent important low and the second pause was approximately the level from which the sharpest part of the previous huge rally started , which was strengthened by another support level ( the previous low ) . 
1	14	 We do n't have price levels that would be 100 % analogous , but we can see which levels are most similar . 
1	14	 In our view , the most recent important lows would be close to the $ 1,200 level ( March , May , and July 2017 bottoms ) and the next strong support will be provided by the $ 1,120 - $ 1,130 area . 
1	14	 That 's approximately from where gold soared most sharply in early 2016 and this level is strengthened by the December 2016 low . 
1	14	 These levels are most likely to generate support strong enough to trigger at least corrective rallies based on the analogy to what we saw in 2008 and based on their own strength as support . 
1	14	 Naturally , that 's what appears likely based on the data that we have today and the likely scenario could change as new developments unfold . 
1	14	 There 's one more thing that we left for the analytical dessert . 
1	14	 Namely , back in 2008 the previous key low ( September 2008 low , which is analogous to the late 2015 bottom ) did n't trigger even a small rally . 
1	14	 Consequently , even though a bottom or at least a correction will be widely expected once gold moves below $ 1,100 , gold may continue to move lower and slide through $ 1,050 like a hot knife through butter . 
1	14	 Finally , there 's one more thing that makes the current situation in gold similar to 2008 - the overall increase in the volume levels . 
1	14	 We already discussed , why the yearly volume levels at record highs should not be viewed as bullish ( final part of the November 14 alert that we 're linking to ) and today we would like to add the observation that back in 2008 the volume levels also broke to new highs and stayed there for a long time . 
1	14	 Yes , the volume has been growing almost constantly , but the 2008 and 2017 buildups in volume still stand out . 
1	14	 The growth is much sharper than in other years and no other period is comparable to those years . 
1	14	 Since the 2008 volume buildup was followed by a sharp decline in the precious metals sector , it seems that we might see something similar also this and/or the next year . 
1	14	 Summing up , there are multiple bearish signals in the gold market and in the rest of the precious metals sector and the analogies to previous major declines further support the bearish outlook . 
1	14	 The big decline in PMs appears to be underway as the previously discussed long - term signals remain in place : gold 's huge monthly volume , the analogy in the HUI Index , the analogy between the two most recent series of interest rate hikes , and the RSI signal from gold priced in the Japanese yen . 
1	14	 To summarize : 
1	14	 Trading capital ( supplementary part of the portfolio ; our opinion ) : Short positions ( 150 % of the full position ) in gold , silver and mining stocks are justified from the risk / reward perspective with the following stop - loss orders and exit price levels / profit - take orders : 
1	14	 Gold : exit price : $ 1,218 ; stop - loss : $ 1,366 ; exit price for the DGLD ETN : $ 51.98 ; stop - loss for the DGLD ETN $ 38.74 Silver : exit price : $ 15.82 ; stop - loss : $ 19.22 ; exit price for the DSLV ETN : $ 28.88 ; stop - loss for the DSLV ETN $ 17.93 Mining stocks ( price levels for the GDX ETF ) : exit price : $ 21.23 ; stop - loss : $ 26.34 ; exit price for the DUST ETF : $ 29.97 ; stop - loss for the DUST ETF $ 21.37 
1	14	 In case one wants to bet on junior mining stocks ' prices ( we do not suggest doing so - we think senior mining stocks are more predictable in the case of short - term trades - if one wants to do it anyway , we provide the details ) , here are the stop - loss details and exit prices : 
1	14	 GDXJ ETF : exit price : $ 30.28 ; stop - loss : $ 45.31 JDST ETF : exit price : $ 66.27 ; stop - loss : $ 43.12

1	14	 Whether you already subscribed or not , we encourage you to find out how to make the most of our alerts and read our replies to the most common alert - and - gold - trading - related - questions . 
1	14	 Please note that the in the trading section we describe the situation for the day that the alert is posted . 
1	14	 In other words , it we are writing about a speculative position , it means that it is up - to - date on the day it was posted . 
1	14	 We are also featuring the initial target prices , so that you can decide whether keeping a position on a given day is something that is in tune with your approach ( some moves are too small for medium - term traders and some might appear too big for day - traders ) . 
1	14	 Plus , you might want to read why our stop - loss orders are usually relatively far from the current price . 
1	14	 Please note that a full position does n't mean using all of the capital for a given trade . 
1	14	 You will find details on our thoughts on gold portfolio structuring in the Key Insights section on our website . 
1	14	" As a reminder - "" initial target price "" means exactly that - an "" initial "" one , it 's not a price level at which we suggest closing positions . "
1	14	 If this becomes the case ( like it did in the previous trade ) we will refer to these levels as levels of exit orders ( exactly as we 've done previously ) . 
1	14	" Stop - loss levels , however , are naturally not "" initial "" , but something that , in our opinion , might be entered as an order . "
1	14	" Since it is impossible to synchronize target prices and stop - loss levels for all the ETFs and ETNs with the main markets that we provide these levels for ( gold , silver and mining stocks - the GDX ETF ) , the stop - loss levels and target prices for other ETNs and ETF ( among other : UGLD , DGLD , USLV , DSLV , NUGT , DUST , JNUG , JDST ) are provided as supplementary , and not as "" final "" . "
1	14	" This means that if a stop - loss or a target level is reached for any of the "" additional instruments "" ( DGLD for instance ) , but not for the "" main instrument "" ( gold in this case ) , we will view positions in both gold and DGLD as still open and the stop - loss for DGLD would have to be moved lower . "
1	14	 On the other hand , if gold moves to a stop - loss level but DGLD does n't , then we will view both positions ( in gold and DGLD ) as closed . 
1	14	 In other words , since it 's not possible to be 100 % certain that each related instrument moves to a given level when the underlying instrument does , we ca n't provide levels that would be binding . 
1	14	 The levels that we do provide are our best estimate of the levels that will correspond to the levels in the underlying assets , but it will be the underlying assets that one will need to focus on regarding the signs pointing to closing a given position or keeping it open . 
1	14	" We might adjust the levels in the "" additional instruments "" without adjusting the levels in the "" main instruments "" , which will simply mean that we have improved our estimation of these levels , not that we changed our outlook on the markets . "
1	14	 We are already working on a tool that would update these levels on a daily basis for the most popular ETFs , ETNs and individual mining stocks . 
1	14	 Our preferred ways to invest in and to trade gold along with the reasoning can be found in the how to buy gold section . 
1	14	 Additionally , our preferred ETFs and ETNs can be found in our Gold & Silver ETF Ranking . 
1	14	 As a reminder , Gold & Silver Trading Alerts are posted before or on each trading day ( we usually post them before the opening bell , but we do n't promise doing that each day ) .

1	16	" While North Korea dominated much of the news of late and the recent events in Charlottesville , VA have been the talk of the internet over the last couple of days , the recent revelation of the "" Memo that rocked Washington , "" which exposes the deep state subversion against President Trump and explaining the tactics being utilized , is being spun as "" crazy "" with the writer of the memo being labeled a "" nutcase "" by the MSM , who has converged on a narrative in a weak attempt at damage control . "
1	16	 The memo is embedded in full below , so readers can read the seven - page memorandum produced in May by the former director of strategic planning at the National Security Council , Rich Higgins . 
1	16	" Before we detail some of the highlights from the memo , then offer the document in full , lets take a look at Higgins credentials , the man that the media is doing their best to discredit with labels like nutcase ( MediaIte ) with outlets like Washington Post calling the memo itself "" crazy . "" "
1	16	 Not only was Higgins the the former director of strategic planning for the NSC , before being fired by Lt . 
1	16	 Gen. H.R. McMaster for writing the memorandum , but perhaps more impressive , the Army veteran was also a former Pentagon official who specialized in irregular warfare . 
1	16	 Department of Defense defines Irregular Warfare in a 100 page document from 2007 , in the following manner : 
1	16	 Irregular warfare ( IW ) is defined as a violent struggle among state and nonstate actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations . 
1	16	 IW favors indirect and asymmetric approaches , though it may employ the full range of military and other capabilities , in order to erode an adversary 's power , influence , and will . 
1	16	 It is inherently a protracted struggle that will test the resolve of our Nation and our strategic partners . 
1	16	 Our adversaries will pursue IW strategies , employing a hybrid of irregular , disruptive , traditional , and catastrophiccapabilities to undermine and erode the influence and will of the United States and our strategic partners . 
1	16	 Meeting these challenges and combating this approach will require the concerted efforts of all available instruments of US national power . 
1	16	 Influencing foreign governments and populations is a complex and inherently political activity . 
1	16	 This Joint Operating Concept ( JOC ) describes the military role in protracted IW campaigns ; however , these campaigns will fail if waged by military means alone . 
1	16	 The nature of IW requires the US Government ( USG ) to achieve the level of unified action necessary to integrate all available instruments of national power to address irregular threats . 
1	16	" The USG will have to develop "" Whole of Government "" approaches to waging IW at the political , strategic , operational , and tactical levels . "
1	16	 Other government agencies must build their capacity to operate in unstable or hostile environments . 
1	16	 Revolutionary Hearing Aid Is Now Giving Free Fit & Feel Samples 
1	16	 Irregular warfare is about people , not platforms . 
1	16	 IW depends not just on our military prowess , but also our understanding of such social dynamics as tribal politics , social networks , religious influences , and cultural mores . 
1	16	 People , not platforms and advanced technology , will be the key to IW success . 
1	16	 The joint force will need patient , persistent , and culturally savvy people to build the local relationships and partnerships essential to executing IW . 
1	16	" So a man that specialized in irregular warfare tactics for the Pentagon , writes a seven - page memo which details a plot to overthrow the President of the United States , by globalist members of the deep state , with the intentional help of propaganda being fed to the media in order to influence the public , using tactics he was responsible for observing while at the Pentagon in order to save American militarylives , and the media starts screaming "" nutcase , "" and "" crazy , "" and "" conspiracy theory ! "" "
1	16	 Something does n't smell right here . 
1	16	 MEMO THAT ROCKED THE NSC & SENT THE MSM INTO DAMAGE CONTROL MODE 
1	16	" The memo is titled "" POTUS & Political Warfare , "" and starts off detail some background on the "" information campaigns designed to first undermine , then delegitimize and ultimately remove the President , "" calling it "" political warfare at an unprecedented level that is openly engaged in the direct targeting of a seated president through manipulation of the news cycle . "" "
1	16	" While naming the actors , such as the media , Democrats , establishment Republicans , and explaining what each gains in their political warfare campaign against the president , it is on Page 5 of the document embedded below , where Higgins detailed the "" Adversary Campaign Plan , "" in the following manner : "
1	16	 Adversary Campaign Plan . 
1	16	" Political Warfare has been described as "" propaganda in battledress . "" "
1	16	 The effort directed at President Trump is executed along one overt , as well as two covert , lines of effort : 
1	16	 • The overt line of effort is PUBLICITY . 
1	16	 Publicity is the straightforward projection of a case that builds a picture in the audience 's mind designed to garner support . 
1	16	 It is facts without context and information the adversary wants the audience to possess that creates an impression and sets conditions . 
1	16	 It seeks to establish good will and receptiveness to additional inputs . 
1	16	 • There are two covert lines of effort : PROPOGANDA and INFILTRATION / SUBVERSION . 
1	16	 o Propaganda is the deliberate direction , even manipulation , of information to secure a definite outcome . 
1	16	 It is an attempt to direct the thinking of the recipient , without his conscious collaboration , into predetermined channels that are established in the Publicity line of effort . 
1	16	 It is the unwitting conditioning of the recipient by devious methods with an ulterior motive that seeks to move them incrementally over time into greater belief and acceptance of message transmitted in the Publicity line of effort . 
1	16	 o Infiltration and subversion operate internal to the targeted organization in order to inform , target , coordinate , and amplifythe effects of the publicity and propaganda . 
1	16	 Both operate to gather intelligence , obstruct legitimate courses of action , provide inside information , and leak sensitive information that undermines the leadership and suppresses the morale of friendly elements . 
1	16	 o Infiltration of political and social groups within a target state is done for the purpose of extending counter - state influence and control . 
1	16	 The endgame is concealed and may involve illicit activities . 
1	16	 o Subversion undermines or detaches the loyalties of significant political and social groups within the target state and transfers political and/or ideological loyalties to the counter - state . 
1	16	 As thcounter - state forms , a counter - elite of influential individual and key leaders within the target state will later facilitate the legitimacy and permanency of the new regime . 
1	16	" On page # 6 we see "" Political Warfare Executive - The Meaning , Techniques and Methods of Political Warfare , "" which accurately captures what we at ANP have been documenting and reporting on for years , including how the media is being used to deliberately push "" pseudo - realities , "" in a campaign to "" delegitimize President Trump , "" with preferred narratives including the "" Russia hacked the election "" , "" Obstruction of Justice "" , "" Hiding Collusion "" , and "" Putin Puppet . "" "
1	16	" As is explained , each of these "" pseudo - realities , "" is geared toward a specific propaganda point , the first an attempt to push the "" illegitimate "" narrative , the second to push the "" corrupt "" narrative , "" the third to push the "" dishonest "" narrative and the last to push the idea of "" treason . "" "
1	16	 Supporting Narratives . 
1	16	 Meta - narratives are supported by an ongoing series of supporting - narratives that can be swapped out as circumstances warrant . 
1	16	 It is important to recognize that these stories do not have to be true , valid or accurate to serve their purpose . 
1	16	 Over time , deserved or not , the cumulative effect of these supporting narratives will result in a Trump fatigue . 
1	16	 From a political warfare perspective , President Trump 's inability to meet this challenge will cast him as a weak failed leader . 
1	16	 The entire memo is embedded below , read it and decide for yourself . 
1	16	 Below the memo we analyze why a man that specialized in irregular warfare for the Pentagon , was fired by McMasters for detailing what many in the Independent Media have been documenting since Trump won the election . 
1	16	 WHY WAS HIGGINS FIRED ? 
1	16	" We have largely refrained from weighing in on H.R. McMasters , despite the fact that his stances on Iran , Islamic Terrorism , the Paris Accord , were more in line with Obama policy than President Trump 's policy , where in each case McMasters lost his argument and the President aligned himself with the promises made , keeping them rather than allowing McMasters to influence his decisions , but according to recent reports , the second McMasters saw this internal memo , he "" detonated , "" and then proceeded to fire the man that wrote it . "
1	16	 The memo was written in May , but after McMaster discovered it , Higgins was called into the White House counsel 's office on July 18 and questioned about it . 
1	16	 On July 21 , he was fired by McMaster 's deputy , but not explicitly given a reason why . 
1	16	" As to McMasters stances on a variety of issues that do not align with the president 's base , that can be chalked up to "" politics "" as Trump the businessman was well known for hiring people with opposing views as to look at all angles before making his decisions , it was not surprising in the least that he brought McMasters on . "
1	16	" The firing of the director of strategic planning for the NSC on the other hand , for utilizing his experience in known irregular warfare methods for and tactics for the Pentagon , to warn of a campaign against a sitting president by multiple factions , including globalists , deep state members within the intelligence community , and the media , forces us to ask the question of whether McMasters is part of the "" political warfare "" campaign against President Trump ? "
1	16	 That is a question President Trump should be asking . 
1	16	 BOTTOM LINE 
1	16	" The fact that the media was called out directly in the memo , highlighting the part they play in pushing "" pseudo - realities , "" in order to generate a narrative to influence the general public , explains clearly why they are in all - out damage control mode trying to discredit the writer of the NSC memo that rocked Washington , because he just publicly exposed them all . "
1	16	 The fact that the media , Trump haters , neverTrumpers , establishment Republicans , and Democrats are all supporting McMasters , also begs the question : Is he one of the enemy within ? 
1	16	 The fact that he fired a man trying to protect the president from other enemies within , might be the answer to that question .

0	20	Las Vegas Metro Police hold a press conference to discuss the ... 
0	20	 During a press conference , Las Vegas Metro Police under Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters that the department is still unclear on shooter Stephen Paddock 's motivation for the attack he perpetrated earlier this week . 
0	20	 Lombardo also asked anyone with more information about the attack to come forward . 
0	20	 He said that he believed that someone must have seen something that was out of place , whether it was suspicious activity , or someone who seemed to be acting strangely . 
0	20	" The girlfriend of the man behind a recent mass shooting in Las Vegas told investigators he displayed "" mental health symptoms "" before the attack , according to NBC News . "
0	20	 NBC News on Friday reported that one former FBI official briefed on the matter confirmed that Marilou Danley recently made the remark about Stephen Paddock . 
0	20	" "" [ Danley ] said he would lie in bed , just moaning and screaming , ‘ Oh , my God , ' "" another former FBI official aware of the situation said . "
0	20	 NBC News 's sources said Paddock may have been in mental or physical anguish before committing the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history last Sunday . 
0	20	 Accusations of fake news are everywhere lately . 
0	20	 How well can you tell apart the actual fake headlines from the real ones in this quiz ? 
0	20	 Test your skills ! 
0	20	 The sources added , however , that the FBI has not yet identified what motivated Paddock to open fire upon an outdoor concert . 
0	20	 The FBI also does not believe Paddock 's mental health had eroded to a point that would have triggered him to begin his rampage , according to NBC 's sources . 
0	20	 Federal and state law enforcement officials additionally confirmed to NBC News that Paddock had been prescribed an anti - anxiety medication called Valium . 
0	20	 Some Twitter users on Friday speculated about Danley and her reported remarks to investigators about her boyfriend . 
0	20	 One of the former FBI officials said that investigators are additionally scrutinizing about six media devices Paddock left behind . 
0	20	 The search includes an inquiry into Paddock 's web browsing history before he began shooting at a country music event last weekend . 
0	20	 Responding police found Paddock dead inside his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino . 
0	20	 The shooting killed at least 58 people and wounded more than 527 others , sparking renewed national debate over gun control .Las Vegas Police still unsure of concert shooter 's motive
0	21	During Drew Brees ' media whirlwind in New York on Tuesday , the New Orleans Saints quarterback levied yet another serious criticism of the NFL . 
0	21	 He said that the suspended Saints coaches are afraid of speaking out about their situation . 
0	21	" "" I 've been informed a lot of those coaches feel there are further sanctions being held over their head if they do n't cooperate with the investigation , "" Brees said on The Dan Patrick Show , via ProFootballTalk . "" "
0	21	" If they were to speak out on behalf of the players , maybe that 's the fear they have . "" "
0	21	 NFL spokesman Greg Aiello has told a variety of outlets that there is simply no truth to Brees ' claims . 
0	21	" "" Of course people are free to speak , as Joe Vitt has done , "" Aiello told Around the League on Wednesday . "
0	21	 ProFootballTalk 's Mike Florio reported that Sean Payton and Gregg Williams fear further retribution if they say anything . 
0	21	 As Aiello points out , Saints interim coach Joe Vitt has spoken out against the league . 
0	21	 Vitt wondered aloud if NFL evidence has been tampered with . 
0	21	 After Williams ' indefinite suspension was announced , the league indicated that Williams ' cooperation with future proceedings would be a factor in his possible reinstatement . 
0	21	" "" Commissioner Goodell said he will give close attention to the extent to which Coach Williams cooperates with the NFL in any further proceedings , "" the league explained in a March 21 statement detailing Williams ' punishment . "
0	21	 Cooperating with proceedings does n't mean Williams has to take a vow of silence . 
0	21	 But that 's essentially what he 's done to this point . 
0	21	 The back - and - forth between the players and the league over the bounty evidence is seemingly never - ending . 
0	21	 We would be surprised if the coaches got involved publicly . 
0	21	 Payton and Williams have openly apologized , admitted their mistakes , and seem to want to move past the controversy as much as possible .NFL : ' Of course ' bounty coaches are ' free to speak '
0	22	Do n't be surprised if you hear President Obama making robocalls to your home on behalf of local candidates this election season . 
0	22	 The President has endorsed three Washington state legislative candidates , in an effort to help Democrats make gains down ballot . 
0	22	 The candidates include Lisa Wellman , who is challenging Republican Steve Litzow for his senate seat in the 41st legislative district that includes Mercer Island and Bellevue . 
0	22	 Wellman , a first time candidate , took the lead in the August primary by under 500 votes . 
0	22	 Democratic challengers in both state house races in legislative district 30 also received endorsements . 
0	22	 Kristine Reeves is challenging Republican Teri Hickel elected to position two during a special election last year . 
0	22	 Mike Pellicciotti is challenging Republican incumbent Linda Kochmar . 
0	22	 Both Reeves and Pellicciotti held slight leads in their respective races . 
0	22	 With two weeks until Election Day , President Obama recorded audio for the candidates to be used in robocalls or radio and digital ads . 
0	22	 An ad for Governor Inslee featuring the President also began airing this week . 
0	22	 Mr. Obama fundraised for Inslee in Seattle earlier this year . 
0	22	 Mailers , social media posts and TV ads are also part of the strategy to take back seats in state legislatures nationwide during what Democrats hope could be a wave election year .

1	23	Mining is one of the most destructive forces currently on the face of the planet . 
1	23	 Mines , since the Industrial Era , have poisoned the environment and its workers alike . 
1	23	 Gold mining is particularly destructive as its waste carries mercury and cyanide , which are typically used to extract gold from rock . 
1	23	 These potent neurotoxins persist in the environment , poisoning the soil , and contaminate water supplies permanently . 
1	23	 Gold mining also releases hundreds of tons of elemental mercury into the air annually . 
1	23	" In addition , this type of mining is considered particularly destructive because of its wastefulness - over 20 tons of rock and soil must be "" treated "" and then dislodged to produce enough gold for a single ring . "
1	23	 Recently , in the US , the toxic consequences of gold mining were on full display when the Environmental Protection Agency 's incompetence in cleaning out an abandoned gold mine turned the Animas river orange after heavy metal - laden mining waste drained into the river . 
1	23	 Before this tragic accident , the EPA had reported that 40 % of Western US watersheds had been permanently contaminated by mining . 
1	23	 The camouflaged drones Credit - Rick Stevens 
1	23	 Now that gold mining is not as common as it once was in the US , many other countries have been exploited by gold mining firms in its absence . 
1	23	 One of these countries is Australia . 
1	23	 Mining in Australia is a major industry with gold mining in Western Australia alone generating over $ 10 billion every year . 
1	23	 However , some of the gold mines there have been experiencing a costly and unexpected problem as nature has apparently decided to fight back against its incursions . 
1	23	 Drones that are used to survey the territory around gold mines are being destroyed by native wedge - tailed eagles . 
1	23	" Rick Steven , a mine surveyor in the region , said that he had lost nine of his Trimble UX5 drones to eagles , which he labeled "" the natural enemy "" of drones . "
1	23	 After the attacks began , Steven camouflaged his drones as baby eagles . 
1	23	 However , the ruse only worked temporarily as 50 flights later the eagles realized the disguised drones were not what they seemed . 
1	23	 Each of these drones costs an impressive $ 20,000 , meaning that gold mining companies are losing money fast thanks to the eagles ' intervention . 
1	23	 One of these companies , Gold Fields , has already lost over $ 100,000 . 
1	23	 This is n't the first case of animals fighting back against the degradation of the environment in recent months . 
1	23	 Less than a month ago , a herd of wild buffalo appeared out of nowhere in a seeming show of support to the Native Americans and their allies protesting the Dakota Access pipeline . 
1	23	 The buffalo , who are considered sacred by the Sioux tribe , appeared by the thousands in a stampede that interrupted a confrontation between protestors and police . 
1	23	 After the event , many speculated that the buffalo had appeared to show their solidarity with the protestors and indicated that nature was fighting back against exploitative corporate practices . 
1	23	 Hopefully , these acts of defiance from the natural world will inspire people to follow their lead in taking a stand against the corporations destroying the planet .

0	24	Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Raleigh , North Carolina . ( 
0	24	 Getty ) 
0	24	 Heading into Election Day 2016 , the Donald Trump campaign has a very specific path to 270 Electoral College votes . 
0	24	 In order to win the election , Trump must win nearly every single battleground state and retain every state that Mitt Romney won in 2012 as well . 
0	24	 Plus , there are a few states that Trump is hoping to flip from blue to red . 
0	24	 So what exactly are the states that Trump needs to win if he hopes to become president ? 
0	24	 First , there are 21 states that Donald Trump will win essentially by default . 
0	24	 These are the states that traditionally always vote for the Republican candidate , and they add up to 163 Electoral College votes . 
0	24	 If Hillary Clinton were to somewhat win in just one of these states , it would be a complete shock . 
0	24	 The states are : 
0	24	 Alabama Alaska Arkansas Idaho Indiana Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska North Dakota Oklahoma South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah West Virginia Wyoming 
0	24	 Then there are two states that usually vote for the Republican candidate but where Hillary Clinton has actually been somewhat close in the polls . 
0	24	 Still , it seems likely that these states will stay red as they have been for a long time , but it 's necessary for Trump to defend himself here if he wants to win the election . 
0	24	 Those states are : 
0	24	 Arizona Georgia 
0	24	 If we add these two states to Donald Trump 's column , plus all the traditionally red states , the Republican nominee is now at 190 Electoral College votes . 
0	24	 He needs 80 more votes to become president . 
0	24	 What remains are six battleground states that could realistically be won by either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton . 
0	24	 Those battlegrounds are : 
0	24	 Florida Iowa Maine 's 2nd Congressional District Nevada New Hampshire North Carolina Ohio 
0	24	 All of these states add up to 80 Electoral College votes , meaning that if Trump wins all of the states we have mentioned so far , he hits 270 electors exactly , and he becomes the next president of the United States . 
0	24	 The state that Donald Trump absolutely must win in order to be elected president is Florida . 
0	24	 Technically Trump can win without it , but the path would become so narrow as a result that it 's almost impossible to imagine Hillary Clinton not winning if she turns Florida blue . 
0	24	 If Florida is called for Hillary Clinton on the evening of November 8th , you can essentially consider this the announcement that Hillary Clinton has won the presidency . 
0	24	 Florida is worth 29 Electoral College votes . 
0	24	 Really , though , Trump does not have much wiggle room , and so basically all of the six battleground states - plus one battleground district - are must wins for him . 
0	24	 Because the aforementioned path is so narrow , the Trump campaign is also looking at a fourth category , states that are leaning towards Hillary Clinton and that traditionally vote blue but that Trump hopes he can turn red . 
0	24	 Winning any one of these would dramatically increase his odds of victory , as they would give him some room to lose another battleground state but still win the election . 
0	24	 Winning any of them would also start eating into Hillary Clinton 's path rather than simply forging Donald Trump 's . 
0	24	 Those blue states , accompanied by the lead Hillary Clinton currently has in the polls according to Real Clear Politics , are : 
0	24	 Colorado ( Clinton + 3 ) Michigan ( Clinton + 5 ) Minnesota ( Clinton + 6.4 ) Pennsylvania ( Clinton + 2.8 ) Virginia ( Clinton + 4.3 ) Wisconsin ( Clinton + 6.5 ) 
0	24	 To summarize , with each of the battlegrounds ( Florida , Iowa , Maine 's 2nd Congressional District , Nevada , New Hampshire , North Carolina and Ohio ) losing one means Trump must make up for it by winning a combination of blue states ( Colorado , Michigan , Minnesota , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Wisconsin ) . 
0	24	 If Trump loses a single battleground but does not compensate for it with a victory in a blue state , Hillary Clinton wins the election . 
0	24	 And if Trump loses two battleground states , that will be almost impossible to recover from . 
0	24	 With that in mind , here are a few scenarios , albeit somewhat unlikely scenarios , where Trump could recover from the loss in a battleground state . 
0	24	 If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for New Hampshire Trump loses , or … Trump wins Colorado , bringing him to 275 Trump wins Michigan , bringing him to 282 Trump wins Minnesota , bringing him to 276 Trump wins Pennsylvania , bringing him to 286 Trump wins Virginia , bringing him to 279 Trump wins Wisconsin , bringing him to 276 If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for Nevada Trump loses , or … Trump wins Colorado , bringing him to 273 Trump wins Michigan , bringing him to 280 Trump wins Minnesota , bringing him to 274 Trump wins Pennsylvania , bringing him to 284 Trump wins Wisconsin , bringing him to 274 Trump wins Virginia , bringing him to 277 If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for North Carolina … Trump loses , or … Trump wins Pennsylvania , bringing him to 275 Trump wins Minnesota and Colorado , bringing him to 274 Trump wins Michigan , bringing him to 271 Trump wins Virginia and Colorado , bringing him to 277 Trump wins Virginia and Wisconsin , bringing him to 278 Trump wins Wisconsin and Colorado , bringing him to 274 If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for Ohio … Trump loses , or … Trump wins Michigan and Colorado , bringing him to 277 Trump wins Minnesota and Colorado , bringing him to 271 Trump wins Pennsylvania , bring him to 272 Trump wins Virginia and Colorado , bringing him to 274 Trump wins Wisconsin and Michigan , bringing him to 278 If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for Florida … Trump loses , or … Trump wins Colorado , Minnesota and Wisconsin , bringing him to 270 Trump wins Colorado , Michigan and Wisconsin , bringing him to 276 Trump wins Pennsylvania and Virginia , bringing him to 274 If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for Iowa … Trump loses , or … Trump wins Colorado , bringing him to 273 Trump wins Michigan , bringing him to 280 Trump wins Minnesota , bringing him to 274 Trump wins Pennsylvania , bringing him to 284 Trump wins Virginia , bringing him to 277 Trump wins Wisconsin , bringing him to 274 If Trump wins all the battlegrounds except for Maine 's 2nd Congressional District … Trump loses , or … Trump wins Colorado , bringing him to 278 Trump wins Michigan , bringing him to 285 Trump wins Minnesota , bringing him to 279 Trump wins Pennsylvania , bringing him to 289 Trump wins Virginia , bringing him to 282 Trump wins Wisconsin , bringing him to 279

0	25	"Appearing on NBC 's "" Meet the Press "" , former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway called on President Obama and Secretary Hillary Clinton to calm protests that have broken out in opposition to Donald Trump 's election as president . "
0	25	" Referencing thousands of protesters outside Trump Tower in Manhattan , chanting "" Not my president "" , Conway said "" I think it 's time for them to give this man a chance , too . "" "
0	25	" According to Conway , President - Elect Trump has already addressed the protesters and "" he will continue to address them . "
0	25	" He 's going to be the president of all people . "" "
0	25	" But , she added , "" This is a two - way street . "" "
0	25	" "" It 's time really for President Obama and Secretary Clinton to say to these protesters : ‘ This man is our president , ' "" Conway continued . "
0	25	" Conway cited what she claimed was media hypocrisy , saying that if Hillary Clinton had won and "" if there were two Donald Trump protesters somewhere , people would be freaking out that his supporters were not accepting the election results . "" "
0	25	 Speculation has already begun about what President - Elect Trump 's administration will look like , especially who will serve as his Chief of Staff in the White House . 
0	25	 Conway commented on reports RNC Chair Reince Priebus and Trump Campaign CEO Steve Bannon are the top candidates being considered for the post . 
0	25	" While she said both will "" have big roles in a Trump administration "" , she particularly highlighted what she sees as Bannon 's qualifications for the job . "
0	25	" "" I think having worked with him and known him , Steve Bannon , in this particular campaign , was the general . "
0	25	 And he is much more the Goldman Sachs managing partner and much more the naval officer , I think , than people realize . 
0	25	" That 's a big part of his background . "" "
0	25	" Conway denied that Bannon , who also served as editor of conservative site Breitbart , would come to Washington to proverbially "" burn it down . "" "
0	25	 Finally , Conway commented on recent reports that Hillary Clinton partially blamed her loss in the election on FBI Director James Comey . 
0	25	" While calling Secretary Clinton "" a woman of enormous gifts and talents "" , Conway said "" I just ca n't believe it 's always somebody else 's fault . "

0	26	" Mike Huckabee joined "" Fox & Friends "" to discuss Hillary Clinton 's return to the public eye with a speech over the weekend in the Poconos . "
0	26	 A retired NYPD detective and private investigator running against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio posted a video to Facebook challenging the Democrat to a push - up contest .

0	27	For the third debate in a row , Donald Trump expressed doubt that Russia was behind recent hacks of Democratic groups , putting him at odds not just with Hillary Clinton , but with the entire U.S. intelligence community . 
0	27	" "" She has no idea whether it 's Russia , China , or anybody else , "" Trump said at the final presidential debate held in Las Vegas Wednesday night . "" "
0	27	" Hillary , you have no idea . "" "
0	27	" "" Do you doubt 17 military and civilian agencies , "" Clinton fired back . "
0	27	" "" And our country has no idea , "" Trump said . "" "
0	27	" Yeah , I doubt it , I doubt it . "" "
0	27	 In this case , Clinton had it right . 
0	27	" Two weeks ago , the U.S. intelligence community announced it is "" confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of e - mails . "" "
0	27	 The candidates also challenged on a number of other issues throughout the debate . 
0	27	 On the issue of immigration , Trump said Clinton agreed with his signature proposal . 
0	27	" "" Hillary Clinton wanted the wall . "
0	27	" Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 , "" Trump said . "
0	27	" "" I voted for border security , and there are ... "" Clinton began speaking , before Trump interrupted , "" And the wall . "" "
0	27	 We rate Trump 's claim as partially true . 
0	27	 As a senator , Clinton did vote for a bill to build 700 miles of fencing along parts of the 2,000-mile Southern border , but not a massive wall as Trump has proposed . 
0	27	 Trump accused Clinton Wednesday night of hiring people to disrupt his allies . 
0	27	" "" She 's the one , and Obama , that caused the violence , "" Trump said . "
0	27	 The truth on that score is unclear . 
0	27	 Democratic contractors were caught on video , appearing to plan to provoke Trump supporters . 
0	27	 But there 's no indication Clinton 's campaign paid for it or even knew about it . 
0	27	 As in previous debates , Trump denied making some controversial comments that are immortalized on video . 
0	27	" "" He said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted , "" Clinton said . "
0	27	" "" I did not say that . "
0	27	" I did not say that , "" Trump said . "
0	27	" But in Greensboro , North Carolina , Trump told a crowd , "" Believe me . "
0	27	 She would not be my first choice . 
0	27	" That I can tell you . "" "
0	27	" "" He also went after a disabled reporter , mocked and mimicked him on national television , "" Clinton said . "
0	27	" "" Wrong , "" Trump denied . "
0	27	 But he did that too , at a campaign rally at Myrtle Beach , South Carolina . 
0	27	" "" I do n't remember ! ' "
0	27	" He 's going like , ‘ I do n't remember ! ' "" "
0	27	 Trump said , imitating his physical handicap . 
0	27	 On the budget , Clinton claimed that her proposals on infrastructure and education would not add a penny to the debt because she has ways to pay for all of them . 
0	27	 Independent analysts said that 's false -- her plan add $ 200 billion to the debt over the next decade .

1	28	 How much money did it cost the nation 's taxpayers for Vice President and Official Glarer at North Korea Mike Pence to spend just enough time in Indianapolis on Sunday to storm out of a Colts game in protest of a protest ? 
1	28	 CNN has an estimate just for the plane alone : 
1	28	 According to the Air Force , flying a C-32 , the model of plane used for Air Force 2 , for one hour costs about $ 30,000 . 
1	28	 Pence 's flight from Las Vegas to Indianapolis Saturday took about three hours and 20 minutes , so it cost about $ 100,000 . 
1	28	 Pence then flew from Indianapolis to Los Angeles on Sunday , which took about four hours and 45 minutes , costing about $ 142,500 . 
1	28	 The grand total : about $ 242,500 . 
1	28	 Keep in mind this is just for the plane . 
1	28	 It does not include any of the ancillary costs that accrue anytime the vice president travels anywhere . 
1	28	 There were increased security costs to local police once Pence was on the ground in Indianapolis . 
1	28	 Costs to locals stuck in traffic as roads were likely closed for his motorcade . 
1	28	 Costs to the Colts to increase security at the stadium . 
1	28	 And so on . 
1	28	 All so Pence could release a statement that was the equivalent of his infamous stern gaze across the Demilitarized Zone at North Korea : 
1	28	 I left today 's Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers , our Flag , or our National Anthem . 
1	28	 At a time when so many Americans are inspiring our nation with their courage , resolve , and resilience , now , more than ever , we should rally around our Flag and everything that unites us . 
1	28	 While everyone is entitled to their own opinions , I do n't think it 's too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem . 
1	28	 I stand with President Trump , I stand with our soldiers , and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem . 
1	28	 Pence 's office would like you to think this was just a spontaneous reaction by a man proud of his flag and his nation . 
1	28	" This is belied by the fact that his reporters traveling with him were not allowed out of their vans when they arrived at the Colts ' stadium but were told ahead of time that "" there may be an early departure from the game by VPOTUS . "" "
1	28	 It is also belied by this tweet sent Sunday afternoon by Donald Trump : 
1	28	 I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled , disrespecting our country . 
1	28	 I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen . 
1	28	 The Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers , the former team of Colin Kaepernick , who started the kneeling protests a year ago . 
1	28	 The chances that Mike Pence would see players kneeling were approximately 100 percent . 
1	28	 He knew this ahead of time , yet he still chose to fly from Las Vegas to Indianapolis despite the fact that he had to fly back to California immediately afterwards for fundraisers , just so he could get a picture of himself holding his hand over his heart ( a picture his staff immediately made the header photo on his Twitter page ) before theatrically storming out and scolding the NFL players for offending him . 
1	28	 A real leader might have tried to find out exactly why the players started kneeling in the first place , which was to protest police brutality and racism , and then spoken with them and tried to figure out ways to address their concerns . 
1	28	 Mike Pence did the exact opposite .

1	29	The story is told that one evening , President Lincoln greeted a Congressional delegation , ushered them into his private study and asked their business . 
1	29	" "" We present you with a petition , "" said the group leader , "" demanding that you dismiss General Grant . "" "
1	29	" "" And why should I do that ? "" "
1	29	 asked Lincoln . 
1	29	" "" Grant is a drinker , "" replied the leader . "" "
1	29	" He is known to have been drunk in his tent . "" "
1	29	" The president replied , "" Gentlemen , I wish all my generals drank what Grant drinks ; he wins ! "" "
1	29	 This is how we should regard President Trump 's tweeting and his unbecoming , personal attacks on members of the media . 
1	29	 We may cringe at Mika 's still - bleeding face , as we would in the tent of a drunken general .

1	29	 And on and on . 
1	29	 We are awestruck at the vision , purpose and energy Trump has brought to the leadership of his country .

1	29	" And so we see a level of disgusting personal attack on Mr. Trump such as has never been seen before , including faux - beheadings , calls for his impeachment , calls for his assassination , magazine covers depicting the president 's head with the cross hairs of a rifle at his temple , queries about his sanity , "" professional "" assertions of his imbalance , bastardized Shakespearean plays , allegations that he is a modern Hitler , utterly invented stories of misconduct by Trump or his team , based on unidentified "" sources .

1	29	 She does n't need your advice . 
1	29	 She is already wobbly enough .

0	30	"While officially the White House is condemning the ISIS suicide attacks in Tehran today , in keeping with their policy of being against ISIS , President Trump 's own statement on the matter appeared less than wholly sympathetic , attributing the attacks to Iran "" falling victim to the evil they promote .

0	30	 President Trump has made clear since the campaign that he does not like Iran , and spent much of his recent trip to the Middle East pushing hostility toward Iran , as well as portraying Iran as being to blame for most of the terrorism in the region . 
0	30	 That ISIS is the world 's biggest terrorist organization , and that Iran has been heavily supporting both Iraq and Syria in fighting ISIS , does n't fit into Trump 's narrative , and the fact that ISIS just launched terrorist attacks in Tehran is particularly unwelcome to the US agenda of trying to spin everything wrong in the Middle East as being Iran 's fault . 
0	30	" President Trump 's answer to this , then , is to remind everyone that Iran is a "" state sponsor of terrorism , "" an official designation by the US government which means effectively nothing , and only currently applies to three countries that the US does n't like , none of whom has anything to do with ISIS , al - Qaeda , or other major international terrorist groups .

0	32	 ( Newser ) - Miss America chairman and CEO Sam Haskell resigned Saturday — just a day after saying he would n't , the New York Daily News reports . 
0	32	 He was joined by chairman Lynn Weidner , president and COO Josh Randle , and board member Tammy Haddad . 
0	32	" The resignations of Miss America leadership come after HuffPo published internal emails Thursday that feature Haskell calling a former Miss America winner "" fat and gross "" and joking that he 's one of very few people who have n't had sex with her , according to USA Today . "

0	32	 On Friday , Haskell was suspended pending an investigation as 49 former Miss America winners signed a petition calling on pageant leadership to resign . 
0	32	" Haskell remained adamant that he would n't resign over what he said were false accusations and a "" mistake of words . "" "
0	32	 In a statement , the Miss America Organization says Haskell 's resignation will take effect immediately .

0	33	" Clinton asked followers to "" put politics aside "" and "" stand up to the NRA "" . "
0	33	 Her message came shortly after the devastating Las Vegas massacre that left more than 50 dead and 200 injured . 
0	33	 Our grief is n't enough .

1	34	When the Graham - Cassidy bill failed to reach the Senate floor last week , the media wanted to put a stake in the heart of the administration 's agenda , declaring all Obamacare repeal efforts to be dead . 
1	34	 For the millions of Americans struggling under the Affordable Care Act regime , however , the fight to make lemonade out of lemons must continue this fall . 
1	34	 Luckily , conservatives in Congress who want to see the end of Obamacare and understand the perils of inaction are not giving up . 
1	34	 Earlier this week , America Rising Squared , a conservative policy organization which I lead , issued a path forward . 
1	34	 We outline five popular conservative actions Congress and the president can take by the end of the year to protect taxpayers and those disproportionately harmed by the ACA while the larger repeal effort remains delayed until next year . 
1	34	 The first step is to protect them from new Obamacare taxes coming in January . 
1	34	 Americans should be encouraged to know that conservatives in the Senate have introduced legislation to stop the health insurance tax and the medical device tax . 
1	34	 Cory Gardner ( R - Colo . ) 
1	34	 and 10 fellow conservative senators , including Ted Cruz ( R - Texas ) and Ron Johnson ( R - Wis . ) , 
1	34	 introduced legislation last week to stop the insurance tax . 
1	34	 In the House , a bipartisan effort is underway to do the same , led by Republican Rep. Kristi Noem of South Dakota and Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona . 
1	34	 These members of Congress understand that Obamacare taxes will harm Americans of all walks of life , and will disproportionately harm seniors and small businesses . 
1	34	 In all , if Congress fails to act , the health insurance tax would amount to a new annual $ 14.3 billion tax increase . 
1	34	 Republicans do n't want to see a tax hike go into effect on their watch , and Democrats do n't want to put more of a burden on vulnerable Americans , so action is required now . 
1	34	 Second , there should be no bailouts for Obamacare . 
1	34	 While bipartisanship is a key to success in getting legislation passed , the president and conservatives in Congress ought to fight back against all efforts to bail out this law . 
1	34	 When House Republicans sued President Obama in 2014 over the health - care act 's cost - sharing subsidies , a federal judge sided with the plaintiffs , deeming these bailouts unconstitutional . 
1	34	 The Obama administration appealed , so today President Trump can easily drop that appeal and end unconstitutional Obamacare cronyism . 
1	34	 Liberals in the Senate want new bailouts , but conservatives such as Cruz have warned colleagues that they must oppose any such efforts . 
1	34	 The third step needed to cripple the health care law and protect Americans is for President Trump to direct the IRS to weaken the individual mandate and expand the hardship exemptions . 
1	34	" The individual mandate has forced many Americans to purchase coverage they do not want and can not afford , and even candidate Obama admitted in 2008 that under Massachusetts ' plan , "" there are people who are paying ﬁnes and still ca n't afford [ health insurance ] , so now they 're worse off than they were . "" "
1	34	 He was right , and President Trump can give these Americans relief from fines easily by directing the IRS to ease the mandate . 
1	34	 The two final steps the president and Republicans in Congress can take before the end of the year is to fully implement 90 percent cuts to Obamacare marketing , which would save the federal government some $ 90 million , and fully protect American seniors from new taxes on Medicare plans . 
1	34	 Among the taxes going into effect next year , those enrolled in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D will see taxes increased nearly $ 3,000 each over the next decade if Congress fails to act . 
1	34	 Time is running out , and President Trump and Republicans in Congress must act now to stop new Obamacare taxes , end the cronyism of bailouts , free Americans from burdensome federal mandates , cut wasteful ACA marketing , and protect America 's seniors . 
1	34	 President Trump and conservatives have it within their power today to stop the most harmful aspects of the health care law , but time is short ; the time to act is now .

1	35	As the New Year 5778 begins , 88 % of Israeli Jews say that they are happy and satisfied with their lives . 
1	35	 This makes sense . 
1	35	 Israel 's relative security , its prosperity , freedom , and spiritual blossoming make Israeli Jews the most successful Jewish community in 3,500 years of Jewish history . 
1	35	 The same can not be said for the Jews of the Diaspora . 
1	35	 In Western Europe , Jewish communities that just a generation ago were considered safe and prosperous are now besieged . 
1	35	 Synagogues and Jewish schools look like army barracks . 
1	35	 And the severe security cordons Jews need to pass through to pray and study are entirely justified . 
1	35	 For where they are absent , as they were at the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket in Paris in 2015 , assailants strike . 
1	35	 Western European Jewry 's crisis is exogenous to the Jewish communities . 
1	35	 It is n't the Jews who caused the crisis , which may in time cause the wholesale exodus of the Jews from Europe . 
1	35	 The crisis is a function of growing levels of popular antisemitism spurred by mass immigration from the Islamic world and the resurgence of indigenous European Jew - hatred , particularly on the far Left . 
1	35	 This is not the situation among American Jewry , which at the dawn of 5778 also finds itself steeped in an ever - deepening crisis . 
1	35	 And while antisemitism is a growing problem in America , particularly on university campuses , unlike their European counterparts , American Jews could mount and win a battle against the growing anti - Jewish forces . 
1	35	 But in large part , they have chosen not to . 
1	35	 And they have chosen not to fight the anti - Semites because they are in the midst of a self - induced identity crisis . 
1	35	 First , there is the problem of demographic collapse . 
1	35	 According to the Pew Research Center 's 2013 study of American Jewry , nearly 60 % of American Jews intermarry . 
1	35	 Based on the Pew data , the Jewish People Policy Institute published a report in June that noted that not only are 60 % of American Jews who get married marrying non - Jews , only half of American Jews are getting married at all . 
1	35	 And among those who are getting married , less than a third are raising their children as Jewish in some way . 
1	35	 Earlier this month , a study of American Jews was published by the Public Religion Research Institute . 
1	35	 It found that not only has n't the situation improved since the Pew survey was published , the trend toward assimilation and loss of Jewish identity among American Jews has accelerated . 
1	35	 In 2013 , 32 % of American Jews under 30 said that they were not Jews by religion . 
1	35	 Today the proportion of Jews under 30 who say they have no relation to the Jewish faith has ballooned to 47 % . 
1	35	 Not surprisingly , the wholesale abandonment of Jewish faith by nearly half of young American Jews has taken a toll on the two liberal streams of American Judaism . 
1	35	 According to the study , the percentage of American Jews who identify as Reform or Conservative Jews is in free fall . 
1	35	 Whereas in 2013 , 35 % of American Jews identified as Reform , today , a mere four years later , only 28 % identify as Reform . 
1	35	 The situation among Conservatives is even worse . 
1	35	 In 2013 , 18 % of American Jews identified as Conservatives . 
1	35	 Today , only 14 % do . 
1	35	 Among Jews , under 30 the situation is even starker . 
1	35	 Only 20 % of American Jews under 30 identify as Reform . 
1	35	 Only 8 % identify as Conservative . 
1	35	 To be sure , the trend toward secularism and assimilation among US Jewry is not new . 
1	35	 And over the years , Reform and Conservative leaders have adopted varying strategies to deal with it . 
1	35	 In 1999 the Reform movement tried to deal with the problem by strengthening the movement 's religious practices . 
1	35	 Although the effort failed , the impulse that drove the strategy was rational . 
1	35	 American Jews who seek spiritual and religious meaning likely want more than a sermon about Tikkun Olam . 
1	35	 The problem is that they also want more than a rabbi donning a kippa and a synagogue choosing to keep kosher . 
1	35	 This is why , as the number of Reform and Conservative Jews is contracting , the number of American Jews who associate with the Orthodox movement is growing . 
1	35	 Between 2013 and 2017 , the proportion of young American Jews who identify as Orthodox grew from 10 % to 15 % . 
1	35	 Moreover , more and more American Jews are finding their spiritual home with Chabad . 
1	35	 Today there are more Chabad houses in the US than Reform synagogues . 
1	35	 Unable to compete for Jews seeking religious fulfillment , the Reform and Conservative movements have struck out for new means of rallying their bases and attracting members . 
1	35	 Over the past year , two new strategies are dominating the public actions of both movements . 
1	35	 First , there is a selective fight against antisemitism . 
1	35	 While antisemitism is experiencing a growth spurt in the US progressive movement , and antisemitism is becoming increasingly overt in US Muslim communities , neither the Reform nor Conservative movements have taken significant institutional steps to fight them . 
1	35	 Instead , both movements , and a large swath of the Jewish institutional world , led in large part by Reform and Conservative Jews , have either turned a blind eye to this antisemitism or supported it . 
1	35	 Take for instance the case of Davis , California , imam Amman Shahin . 
1	35	 $ 107 Billion Treasure Found From WW2 ! 
1	35	 You Wo n't Believe Where It Was Stashed 
1	35	 On July 21 Shahin gave a sermon calling for the Jewish people to be annihilated . 
1	35	 His Jewish neighbors in the progressive Jewish communities of Davis and Sacramento did n't call the police and demand that he be investigated for terrorist ties . 
1	35	 They did n't demand that his mosque fire him . 
1	35	 Instead , led by the Oakland Jewish Federation , local rabbi Seth Castleman , and the JCRC , they embraced Shahin . 
1	35	" They appeared with him at a public "" apology "" ceremony , where he failed to apologize for calling for his Jewish colleagues , and every other Jew , to be murdered . "
1	35	 All Shahin did express regret that his call for genocide caused offense . 
1	35	 On the other hand , the same leaders stand as one against allegations of antisemitic violence stemming from the political Right . 
1	35	 In the face of an utter lack of evidence , when Jewish institutions were subjected to a rash of bomb threats last winter , Reform and Conservative leaders led the charge insisting that far - right antisemites were behind them and insinuated that the perpetrators supported President Donald Trump . 
1	35	 When it worked out that all of the threats were carried out by a mentally ill Israeli Jew , they never issued an apology . 
1	35	 So , too , the Reform and Conservative movements , like the rest of the American Jewish community , treated the Charlottesville riot last month like a new Reichstag fire . 
1	35	 They entirely ignored the violence of the far - left , antisemitic Antifa protesters and behaved as though tomorrow neo - Nazis would take control of the federal government . 
1	35	 They jumped on the bandwagon insisting that Trump 's initial condemnation of both groups was proof that he has a soft spot for neo - Nazis . 
1	35	 The problem with the strategy of selective outrage over antisemitism is that it is n't at all clear who the target audience is . 
1	35	 Survey data shows that the more active Jews are in the synagogue , the less politically radical they are and the more devoted to Jewish causes they are . 
1	35	 So it is hard to see how turning a blind eye to leftist and Muslim antisemitism will rally their current membership more than they already have been rallied . 
1	35	 Moreover , the more radicalized Jews become politically , the more outlets they have for their political activism both as Jews and as leftists . 
1	35	 No matter how anti - Trump Conservative and Reform leaders become , they can never rival the progressive forces in the Democratic Party . 
1	35	 Prospects for success of the second strategy are arguably even lower . 
1	35	 The second strategy involves cultivating animosity toward Israel over the issue of egalitarian prayer at the Kotel . 
1	35	 Last June , the government overturned an earlier decision to build a passageway connecting the Western Wall Plaza with Robinson 's Arch , along with the Southern Wall , where egalitarian prayer services are held . 
1	35	 The government also rescinded a previous decision to have representatives of the Conservative and Reform movements receive membership in the committee that manages the Western Wall Plaza . 
1	35	 The government 's first decision was non - political . 
1	35	 The Antiquities Authority nixed the construction of the passage due to the adverse impact construction would have on the antiquities below the surface . 
1	35	 As to the second decision , it is far from a matter of life and death . 
1	35	 The committee has no power to influence egalitarian prayers for better or for worse . 
1	35	 And yet , rather than acknowledge that the decision was a setback but it did n't harm the status of egalitarian prayer at the Wall , the Reform and Conservative movements declared war against the government and dragged much of the organized Jewish establishment behind them . 
1	35	 The Reform leadership canceled a scheduled meeting with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , and the Jewish Agency Board followed suit . 
1	35	 Six hundred Conservative rabbis signed a letter to Netanyahu accusing him of betraying Diaspora Jewry and announcing they would be forced to reconsider their support for Israel . 
1	35	 Ambassador David Friedman , who had just taken residence in Israel a month before the explosion , used his first public remarks as ambassador to call his fellow American Jews to order . 
1	35	" Friedman said , "" Yesterday , I heard something that I thought I 'd never heard before . "
1	35	 And I understand the source of the frustration and the source of the anger . 
1	35	 But I heard a major Jewish organization say that they needed to rethink their support for the State of Israel . 
1	35	" "" That 's something unthinkable in my lifetime , up until yesterday . "
1	35	 We have to do better . 
1	35	" We must do better , "" he said . "
1	35	 But in the intervening months , the Conservative and Reform movements have not relented in their attacks . 
1	35	 They have ratcheted them up . 
1	35	 The thinking appears to be that if they can make this problem look like a life or death struggle between Israel and progressive Jewry , they can both keep their dwindling bases engaged and attract members of the increasingly anti - Israel Jewish far Left . 
1	35	 The problem with this is that just as they can not outdo the Democratic Party in their hostility toward Trump , so the Conservative and Reform movements can not be more anti - Israel than Jewish Voices for Peace and other anti - Israel Jewish groups . 
1	35	 The question for Israelis is what this failure of the mainstream American Jewish leadership means for the future of Israel 's relationship with American Jewry . 
1	35	 Jewish survival and continuity through the ages have been predicated and dependent on our ability as Jews to uphold the commandment of the sages that all Jews are responsible for one another . 
1	35	 As the most successful Jewish community in history , Israel has a special responsibility for our brethren in the Diaspora . 
1	35	 The first step toward fulfilling our duty is to recognize the basic fact that while it is true that the American Jewish community is in crisis , the leaders of that community are in an even deeper crisis . 
1	35	 And the key to strengthening and supporting the community is to bypass its failed leadership and speak and interact directly with American Jews .

0	39	There are some cases where , for reasons that the public can seldom understand , the wife of a man accused of something as simple as cheating or as monstrous as sexual assault will stand by her man . 
0	39	 That 's the whole premise of The Good Wife , sort of . 
0	39	 That 's not true of every wife , however . 
0	39	 After all of the accusations against Harvey Weinstein that have come out into the open and been made public , Georgina Chapman is parting ways with the former big - name studio executive after ten years of marriage . 
0	39	 Considering that Harvey Weinstein has been fired from his own company -- the Weinstein Company -- it 's not all that surprising that his wife is taking drastic steps , too . 
0	39	 After these kinds of allegations , it would be hard to understand anyone who would n't put some distance between themselves and the accused . 
0	39	 First came the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment accusations in a New York Times expose . 
0	39	 After decades of rumors , the biggest surprise was n't the nature of the accusations so much as that the article was actually published . 
0	39	 A lot of the times , powerful people pull strings and call in favors to make problems go away . 
0	39	 Some of the allegations were creepy but not damning -- stories about him promising young actresses that he 'd boost their careers if they did certain things for him . 
0	39	 That 's gross , but there are situations ( clearly not involving Weinstein ) where both parties might consent to that sort of arrangement in a way that would benefit everyone . 
0	39	 The other accusations that came out in that same expose -- about coercing women to drink and watch him shower , about pulling out his penis without invitation and masturbating before an unwilling audience -- were beyond just creepy . 
0	39	 Some of those things are crimes and none of them are okay . 
0	39	 Things looked bleak for Harvey Weinstein , and he was condemned by major names in Hollywood . 
0	39	 But accusations sexual misconduct is something that a lot of powerful men can and do somehow get past 
0	39	 Hell , some people who are accused of sexual assault and also famously recorded bragging about it go on to become President . 
0	39	 Men with money can get away with a lot . 
0	39	 Then , yesterday , the New Yorker released more -- allegations of Harvey Weinstein committing sexual assault again and again and again . 
0	39	 A number of actresses came forward as accusers , and his is now accused of outright rape . 
0	39	 Suddenly , his powerful former friends are returning his donations but not his calls . 
0	39	 Weinstein 's career is almost certainly history at this point . 
0	39	 And so , it seems , is his marriage . 
0	39	 Georgina Chapman is a British actress and designer . 
0	39	 Now 41 , she married Harvey Weinstein in 2007 . 
0	39	 The couple has two children together : India Pearl , who is 7 years old , and Dashiell Max Robert , who is 4 . 
0	39	 In a statement to People , Georgina Chapman reveals that she and Harvey Weinstein are separating . 
0	39	" "" My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions . "
0	39	 I have chosen to leave my husband . 
0	39	" Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time . "" "
0	39	 We 've seen a number of extremely bad takes on Harvey Weinstein since this story began to break , but his wife 's statement is exactly on point . 
0	39	 First , she expresses sympathy for his victims . 
0	39	 Second , she makes it clear that sexual assault is unforgivable -- which it is . 
0	39	 Third , she announces that she 's leaving Harvey Weinstein . 
0	39	 And fourth , she emphasizes that she 's putting her children first , which is what every parent should always , always do . 
0	39	 Rose McGowan is naming names , exposing people whom she claims knew about Weinstein 's pattern of predatory behavior and either did nothing or participated in the cover - up . 
0	39	 ( Honestly , bless Rose McGowan for having zero chill about anything , ever ) 
0	39	 Harvey Weinstein already seems like he 's toast , but it could cost others -- possibly even Ben Affleck -- his career . 
0	39	 Something tells us that there are more accusations against Harvey Weinstein out there that just have n't come to light yet . 
0	39	 Things looked bleak for Harvey Weinstein , and he was condemned by major names in Hollywood . 
0	39	 But accusations sexual misconduct is something that a lot of powerful men can and do somehow get past

0	40	FBI Director James Comey caused a major shakeup in the presidential election with his letter Friday revealing a review of newly - discovered emails related to the FBI previously - closed investigation into Hillary Clinton 's use of a private server . 
0	40	 Here is a rundown of what we know ( and what we do n't ) so far : 
0	40	 What emails were discovered ? 
0	40	 Many things remain vague and unknown about the newly uncovered emails . 
0	40	" What we do know is that the FBI believes they are "" pertinent "" to its investigation into Clinton 's use of a private server during her tenure as secretary of State . "
0	40	 According to an official close to the investigation , there are thousands of new emails under review . 
0	40	 What we do n't know is whether they contain any classified material or could have any bearing on the previous investigation . 
0	40	 Could the emails lead to criminal charges against Clinton ? 
0	40	 That is impossible to know at this point . 
0	40	" In a speech Friday , Clinton said she is "" confident "" that the new developments wo n't change the FBI 's recommendation not to prosecute her for improperly handling classified materials . "
0	40	 Although Comey could not put a timetable on how long it will take to review the new material , a source tells USA TODAY that is unlikely it will be completed before Election Day . 
0	40	 What is the connection to Anthony Weiner ? 
0	40	 The emails were discovered as part of an investigation into former New York congressman Anthony Weiner , who is suspected of having sexually charged communications with a 15-year - old girl . 
0	40	 Investigators came across the emails while looking into devices used by Weiner . 
0	40	 Weiner is married to — and currently separated from — longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin who had access to the same device or devices . 
0	40	 Why did Comey make the review public ? 
0	40	" In his letter to lawmakers , informing them of the latest developments , Comey said he thought it was important to update them "" in light of my previous testimony , "" which said the investigation had been concluded . "
0	40	 Did Attorney General Loretta Lynch approve of Comey 's letter to lawmakers ? 
0	40	 No . 
0	40	 Lynch objected to Comey 's decision to notify Congress that the FBI was reviewing newly discovered email , an official familiar with the matter told USA TODAY . 
0	40	 Lynch based her objection on a long - held Justice Department policy that federal authorities should not take any action that may interfere with an election . 
0	40	 Did Lynch try to stop Comey ? 
0	40	 Yes . 
0	40	 Lynch shared her objections just hours before Comey sent the letter , according to USA TODAY 's source . 
0	40	 The FBI director weighed the attorney general 's advice during a spirited discussion of the matter Thursday and early Friday , but in the end , Comey felt compelled to act . 
0	40	 When is the election ? 
0	40	 Tuesday , November 8 .The Hillary Clinton emails : What we know , and what we do n't
1	41	Disgraceful . 
1	41	 Colin Kaepernick is one of the most divisive players to have ever played in the NFL , on the back of his stance against police brutality last year , and his refusal to stand during pre - game national anthems as a result . 
1	41	 Criticism rained down on the former San Francisco 49ers Quarterback for his actions , but he also won support aplenty from fellow athletes and onlookers for his social justice stance . 
1	41	 The 29-year - old is currently unemployed because of his actions , however , and NFL clubs are reluctant to touch him because of the publicity that his protests attract . 
1	41	 Speak out and you 're damned , so it goes . 
1	41	 Kaepernick is one of the most courageous sports stars in the world , and should be lauded for not accepting what others know is wrong , but keep their mouths shut anyway . 
1	41	 Instead , despite being one of the best quarterbacks in the game , he does n't have a club . 
1	41	 US president Donald Trump was speaking at a rally in Alabama on Friday night when he took declining NFL TV ratings to task , going on to claim that the lack of physicality in the game was a reason for this . 
1	41	" Then he turned his attention to the Milwaukee man 's tendency to kneel during national anthems , and without mentioning by name , referred to him as a "" son of a bitch . "" "
1	41	" "" Would n't you love to see one of these NFL Owners , when someone disrespects our flag to say , ‘ get that son of a bitch off the field right now , he 's fired , he 's fired , "" Trump said to the crowd . "

0	42	One of the biggest problems officials face in preparing for a hurricane is that many people simply ignore evacuation orders .

1	43	Disney 's Hollywood Studios is quite often looked at as a ‘ half - day park . ' 
1	43	 People believe that it does n't have much to offer in the form of attractions and entertainment , and so they only spend a few hours in the park dedicated to celebrating film and stage classics . 
1	43	 While Hollywood Studios is undergoing a significant amount of changes as they begin to construct both Star Wars Land and Toy Story Land , this does n't mean that the park does n't have much to offer . 
1	43	 Here are four reasons why we keep going back to Disney 's Hollywood Studios : 
1	43	 4 . 
1	43	 Excellent restaurants 
1	43	 One of the things I love most about Disney 's Hollywood Studios is the table service restaurants because they are so wonderfully themed . 
1	43	 From elegant and classy to old - fashioned and heart - warming , these restaurants do a great job of serving you high quality food with high quality service . 
1	43	 I love the old Hollywood vibe and decadent menu at the Hollywood Brown Derby , especially for a special night out . 
1	43	 I also love the Sci - Fi Dine In Theater , with its unique theming and restaurant setup and classic American menu . 
1	43	 The 50 's Prime Time Café is another great option if you want a fun dining experience , and you 're even allowed to watch TV during dinner . 
1	43	 3 . 
1	43	 Star Wars 
1	43	 If you 're a fan of the classic franchise , then you are definitely going to keep going to Hollywood Studios . 
1	43	 Though Star Wars Land is n't set to open for another few years , there is still an abundance of Star Wars to go around in the meantime . 
1	43	 Guests can ride Star Tours : The Adventure Continues and come face to face with some of the most beloved , and feared , characters of the franchise . 
1	43	 They have even updated the ride to include characters from Star Wars : The Force Awakens . 
1	43	 Fans of Star Wars can also head to the Star Wars Launch Bay located in the animation courtyard . 
1	43	 Inside , they will have the chance to browse through Star Wars merchandise and meet Chewbacca and Kylo Ren . 
1	43	 2 . 
1	43	 Entertainment 
1	43	 Disney 's Hollywood Studios does have quite a fun mix of entertainment , though many people choose to skip right over most of it . 
1	43	 One of the park 's most spectacular forms of entertainment is Beauty and the Beast — Live On Stage . 
1	43	 If you are a fan of the movie and a fan of musicals , this Broadway style show will have you singing and bopping along to the movie 's most inspiring songs . 
1	43	 Another big attraction in the park that I , personally , would consider a form of entertainment is the Frozen sing - a - long in the theatre that once housed the American Idol Experience . 
1	43	 Two Arendelle historians , who bring the house down every time I see it , bring this fun and enchanting retelling of the story to life . 
1	43	 Plus , who does n't love to belt out ‘ Let It Go ' ? 
1	43	 And we ca n't forget about the nighttime show , Fantasmic ! 
1	43	 Step inside Mickey Mouse 's imagination and see just how powerful your dreams can be , complete with plenty of appearances from your favorite Disney characters . 
1	43	 The park has also recently introduced a new holiday nighttime spectacular titled Jingle Bell , Jingle BAM ! 
1	43	 With plenty of special effects , projections and fireworks , it 's sure to become a family favorite . 
1	43	 1 . 
1	43	 Rides 
1	43	 For a park so small , Hollywood Studios has a killer lineup of attractions that is only going to get better as it continues to get expanded . 
1	43	 People come from all over the world just to experience the Tower of Terror , which is a classic ride that has been helping guests ‘ drop in ' since 1994 . 
1	43	 Hollywood Studios is also home to one of the few classic roller coasters Disney has — Rock ‘ N ' Roller Coaster . 
1	43	 With high speeds , twists , turns and funky music , this attraction is a must - do during your time in the park . 
1	43	 One of the more recent additions to the park , and my personal favorite , is Toy Story Midway Mania , which lets you battle your friends and family in five carnival - inspired games inspired by different Toy Story characters . 
1	43	 And , of course , we ca n't forget about The Great Movie Ride , which is a must - do for any film fans visiting the park . 
1	43	 You get to step inside some of the most iconic movie scenes in film history , and you even get to be part of the show as well . 
1	43	 These are only a few of the attractions available to you , but it proves that there are many things that will keep you coming back . 
1	43	 Though many people will try to argue that Disney 's Hollywood Studios is n't a park worth spending an entire day at , there are many reasons why they 're wrong . 
1	43	 With a variety of restaurants , entertainment and attractions , there are plenty of things to do that will keep you and your family entertained all day long . 
1	43	 Be sure to check out all that Hollywood Studios has to offer during your next trip .

1	46	 So there you have it America this cop killer was another radicalized American done in by Obama 's war a cops which Hillary Clinton supported as well . 
1	46	 This once again shows the danger that Obama 's and Hillary 's rhetoric have given cops nationwide , as the last Presidency of Obama in the last two years of his administration made the environment for LEO 's a very dangerous one as both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama stated over and over again that police officers target blacks . 
1	46	 Go figure though we have a cop killer again who is not only a Hillary advocate but an all out Democrat .NY cop killer is a known Hillary supporter
1	47	 It is painfully obvious that the communism lovers in our institutions of higher education have had the run of the asylum and wreaked havoc .  
1	47	 Many liberal talking heads have made a big deal out of the supposed demographic wave facing Republicans and conservatives as the nation morphs into a more diverse population . 
1	47	 Growth rates amongst minorities have begun to exceed those of whites . 
1	47	 The narrative goes like this — as the white , European - based population diminishes , America will become less conservative and more socialist , demanding more and more free stuff . 
1	47	 The rich will just have to pay for it — in other words , the takers will get more from the makers . 
1	47	 While the demographic trend may be true , the pre - conceived outcome is anything but . 
1	47	 I 'm not one to forecast a ‘ conservative century ' , but I will say the notion that the up - and - coming generation largely believes in socialism is a falsehood . 
1	47	 First of all , many minority groups have historically held conservative values . 
1	47	 Although this trend has diminished to some extent , due to the brainwashing and self - imposed victimization of minority youth , it has not gone away entirely . 
1	47	 Hispanics go to church ; they believe in hard work . 
1	47	 I 've know many Hispanic businessmen and families who are angry at the open border crowd pushing for illegal immigration and benefits for millions of undocumented immigrants . 
1	47	 They did not go through the process legally as many immigrants have and this annoys successful minority entrepreneurs . 
1	47	 There is also the fact that ‘ Obamanomics ' and social welfare policies did nothing to help the minority groups he promised to assist . 
1	47	 Aside from increasing dependency on government , every other statistic for prosperity for minorities went down . 
1	47	 No compatible source was found for this video . 
1	47	 Many minorities are starting to see this . 
1	47	 I recently overheard one minority veteran tell someone at the VA that the government aid was helpful but what he really needed was a job . 
1	47	 Trump is right — the dignity of work is a beautiful thing to behold . 
1	47	 The election of President Donald J. Trump has been a game changer when considering the political support for one side of the spectrum . 
1	47	 The identity politics of the Left has done nothing but cause election losses . 
1	47	 That is a fact . 
1	47	 The white , working - class , middle - American will be missing for a long time in the Democratic Party . 
1	47	 Hillary Clinton made it perfectly clear that the Left did not care about flyover country during the election . 
1	47	 The overt racism of Black Lives Matter and other minority hate groups has further cemented this condition . 
1	47	 What does the Left offer the hard - working American ? 
1	47	 It does n't offer a job . 
1	47	 It does n't offer dignity . 
1	47	 It just offers derision of other Americans and government dependency . 
1	47	 This is not what American wants — hence the election of Donald Trump . 
1	47	 Trump sure has delivered , on his promises that is . 
1	47	 Jobs are being created ; economic optimism is soaring ; plants are opening ; coal mines are being dug ; and business investment is growing again . 
1	47	 I read today that Trump will push for America to be the energy capital of the world . 
1	47	 The optimism is only going to grow . 
1	47	 The business climate is only going to get better . 
1	47	 Americans have seen the results of a decade of socialist , liberal , culturally Marxist policies , and they do n't like it . 
1	47	 But most of all , the policies do n't work . 
1	47	 All Obama and his minions brought to the table was failure , massive failure . 
1	47	 Failure in government , failure in the economy , failure in foreign policy and national security , and failure in the ability of a citizen to realize the American dream . 
1	47	 Americans have had enough . 
1	47	 Of course , there will always be those who choose to be dependent on government and live off the largess of others . 
1	47	 But my gut tells me as Trump makes America great again , many of those people will see the light and actually get a job . 
1	47	 The younger generation , who is now moving to college age and called Generation Z , have seen all of this happen . 
1	47	 They have seen their parents struggle . 
1	47	 They have seen their parents lose their dignity . 
1	47	 They have seen their parents becoming dependent on the local commissar for a handout . 
1	47	 They will also see the opposite — they will see the fruits of capitalism . 
1	47	 They will see factories open . 
1	47	 They will feel the optimism . 
1	47	 There will be no where else to attribute this change in circumstances except to Trump and conservative policies . 
1	47	 America is becoming one big learning lab for its younger citizens . 
1	47	 In addition to the national policies changing the face of America , there will be changes in our university and educational systems . 
1	47	 We are at the zenith of cultural Marxism right now in this country . 
1	47	 It is painfully obvious that the communism lovers in our institutions of higher education have had the run of the asylum and wreaked havoc . 
1	47	 There will be changes here . 
1	47	 I do n't know what form it will take or how it will happen , but the groundswell of public outrage and alumni queasiness about the lack of freedom of speech on campus is coming to a head . 
1	47	 There will be consequences . 
1	47	 It is not okay for speech to be restricted anywhere in our educational process . 
1	47	 It is not okay for due process to be withheld from male victims of rape accusations . 
1	47	 It is not okay for tenured professors to spew racist and communist propaganda at our young people . 
1	47	 This will change , I am confident of it . 
1	47	 The pendulum is slowly starting to swing the other way . 
1	47	 Generation Z will face a smaller sea of Neo - Bolsheviks as they enter college . 
1	47	 This is a good thing . 
1	47	 There was a study released recently which delved into the political beliefs and tendencies of Generation Z as they move to take the place of the Millennial generation . 
1	47	 There could not be a more striking divide between the ‘ live in your parent 's basement ' generation and the new group coming of age . 
1	47	 The study concluded that Generation Z is the most conservative since the end of World War II . 
1	47	 This is a stunning revelation and I believe it is due to the factors I have outlined above . 
1	47	 They have been able to observe the two different views of the world , the two ways of living your life as a taker and a maker . 
1	47	 They want to be the latter . 
1	47	 Perhaps it is deeper and more simple than that . 
1	47	 Perhaps they have seen that the Democratic Party — the Left , the ‘ progressives , ' the cultural Marxists , the racists , whatever you want to call this rag - tag opposition to President Trump and Make America Great Again — have nothing to offer that will make their lives more successful or fulfilling . 
1	47	 Perhaps Generation Z has seen with their own eyes that the Democratic Party is nothing more than a huge , stinking mountain of organized crime , that desires to steal from other 's hard work and vision . 
1	47	 Maybe that is why even the term ‘ hard work ' is now deemed a ‘ micro aggression ' by these idiots . 
1	47	 Yes , I believe that America is about to experience a generation of success and prosperity , driven by a reawakening of conservative principles . 
1	47	 Before the election , I did a book signing in a hotel near an airport . 
1	47	 The young manager of the place was an Indian man . 
1	47	 He came over and started asking me questions from time - to - time when the crowd thinned down . 
1	47	 The conversation quickly turned to politics and he guardedly asked me my opinions on Trump and Hillary — I gave them to him . 
1	47	" As I was packing my things to leave an hour or so later , he came over and quietly informed me that he was voting for Trump . "" "
1	47	" My family did things legally , "" he declared , "" I ca n't stand the Democrats . ""The Conservative Warriors of Generation Z"

1	50	 Nine years ago , Christopher Mirasolo , 27 , raped a woman . 
1	50	 She got pregnant as a result of the alleged crime . 
1	50	 Now , Mirasolo — a convicted rapist — has been awarded joint legal custody of the child by Detroit Judge Gregory S. Ross following a DNA paternity test which showed him to be the child 's father . 
1	50	 Yes , you read that correctly . 
1	50	 The man who made a child through rape , was convicted of rape , and served time for rape , will now be granted joint custody of the child born from rape . 
1	50	 The victim 's attorney , Rebecca Kiessling , is now asking for special protection afforded to her client under the federal Rape Survivor Child Custody Act . 
1	50	 The Act , which President Obama signed the Rape Survivor Child Custody Act into law on May 29 , 2015 , terminates the parental rights of any parent who raped the opposite sex . 
1	50	 The decision to terminate the parental rights must be based on clear and convincing evidence that the resulting child was conceived through rape . 
1	50	 Kiessling filed objections last Friday against Ross ' decision to award custody to the parent who 's believed to have raped the lady whose identity must be kept confidential because of the nature of the crime . 
1	50	 Kiessling remarked : 
1	50	 This is insane … Nothing has been right about this since it was originally investigated . 
1	50	 He was never properly charged and should still be sitting behind bars somewhere , but the system is victimizing my client , who was a child herself when this all happened . 
1	50	 So apparently angered by Ross ' decision , the rape victim 's attorney continued by accusing the court of implementing deception to make the ruling . 
1	50	 An assistant prosecutor on this , Eric Scott , told me she had granted her consent , which was a lie — she has never been asked to do this and certainly never signed anything 
1	50	 In granting parental rights to Mirasolo , Ross has prevented the woman from fleeing the presence of her alleged attacker . 
1	50	 In other words , the rape victim now has to be within driving distance of her rapist at all times . 
1	50	 And in a bizarre and some would say ironic turn of events , the rape victim may , in fact , go to jail if she does not comply with the court 's demands . 
1	50	" Kiessling remarked that her client is , "" not allowed to move 100 miles from where she had been living when the case was filed , without court consent . "" "
1	50	" If she does not comply with the order , she can be locked up . "" "
1	50	" So the prosecutor told her she had to come home immediately or she would be held in contempt of court , "" the rape victim 's lawyer said . "
1	50	 For anyone who may be wondering about the details of the alleged rape , the lawyer provided a glimpse into the kind of horrific and violent torture the rape victim allegedly endured . 
1	50	 She said Mirasolo raped her client when her client was just 12 and the man was 18 . 
1	50	 She described the incident in detail . 
1	50	 She , her 13-year - old sister and a friend all slipped out of their house one night to meet a boy and the boy 's older friend , Mirasolo , showed up and asked if they wanted to go for a ride … They thought they were going to McDonald 's or somewhere … Instead , he tossed their cellphones away , drove to Detroit where he stole gas from a station and then drove back to Sanilac County , where he kept them captive for two days in a vacant house near a relative , finally releasing the older sister in a park . 
1	50	 He threatened to kill them if they told anyone what happened . 
1	50	 Instead of prosecuting Mirasolo to the fullest extent of the law , he was offered a plea deal for being a first - time offender and was back on the streets after less than 7 months in jail . 
1	50	 He went on to commit another rape on a young teenager in 2010 and served only four years for the second rape . 
1	50	 Now , Judge Ross has given him parental rights to his first victim . 
1	50	 Barbara Yockey , Mirasolo 's attorney did not indicate her client had any intention of being a parent to the child who happens to be the product of a reportedly brutal rape . 
1	50	 Yockey said the paternity test and subsequent custody proceedings were initiated after the other parent applied for state services . 
1	50	 Chris was notified of the paternity matter and an order of filiation was issued last month by the court saying he had joint legal custody and reasonable visitation privileges … He never initiated this . 
1	50	 It was something routinely done by the prosecutor 's office when a party makes application for state assistance . 
1	50	 The Detroit News also spoke with the mother . 
1	50	 She , too , was unaware of the court 's proceedings . 
1	50	 She said ; 
1	50	 I think this is all crazy … They ( officials ) never explained anything to me . 
1	50	 I was receiving about $ 260 a month in food stamps for me and my son and health insurance for him . 
1	50	 I guess they were trying to see how to get some of the money back . 
1	50	 Following the horrific rape , the victim dropped out of school and moved in with relatives in Florida . 
1	50	 She went to a government office to change her address and was notified she had a court order demanding her return to Detroit . 
1	50	 Part of me did n't want to come back home because I was scared … I would 've got contempt of court if I had n't shown . 
1	50	 I would 've been thrown in jail . 
1	50	 With respect to the rape itself , she said : 
1	50	 I did n't talk about it , I tried to put it behind me , but that 's never possible . 
1	50	 You never forget what happens . 
1	50	 Tiffany , the name she gave to the hosts , which is not her real name , gave her opinion about Ross ' decision to put her rapist 's name on her son 's birth certificate . 
1	50	 ( I 'd been told ) , he 'd have to fight for any kind of rights … Then this judge just hands him these rights , like he deserves them . 
1	50	 She 's not alone in her belief that Mirasolo should be denied parental rights . 
1	50	 The convicted rapist 's second victim shares her sentiments . 
1	50	 She told reporters : 
1	50	 When I read the ( Detroit News ) article , I was disgusted … I guess there is no way they can do anything to him , because he has already served sentences in both cases . 
1	50	 But there is no way he should have custody … And I do n't think he should even be allowed around any children without supervision . 
1	50	 Yes , America , this is the judicial state of affairs in which many of our residents currently endure . 
1	50	 A convicted rapist is given parental rights he did n't want , to a woman who did n't want him to have any association with her or her child , and who 'd even relocated out of state . 
1	50	 The woman was ordered to return to the state where she was raped and forced to live within two hours drive of the perpetrator ( 100 miles ) . 
1	50	 Worse still , she may actually be forced to confront her attacker when and if he ever wants to spend time with his biological child .

1	53	It has to be admitted that Donald Trump is doing exactly what he was elected to do . 
1	53	 He was not elected to be a legislative president . 
1	53	 He never showed any real interest in policy during the campaign . 
1	53	 He was elected to be a cultural president . 
1	53	 He was elected to shred the dominant American culture and to give voice to those who felt voiceless in that culture . 
1	53	 He 's doing that every day . 
1	53	 What 's troubling to me is that those who are the targets of his assaults seem to have no clue about what is going on . 
1	53	 When they feel the most righteous , like this past weekend , they are actually losing and in the most peril . 
1	53	 Let me try to explain what I think is happening : 
1	53	 After World War II the Protestant establishment dominated the high ground of American culture and politics . 
1	53	 That establishment eventually failed . 
1	53	 It tolerated segregation and sexism , led the nation into war in Vietnam and became stultifying . 
1	53	 So in the late 1960s along came a group of provocateurs like Abbie Hoffman , Jerry Rubin and the rest of the counterculture to upend the Protestant establishment . 
1	53	 People like Hoffman were buffoons , but also masters of political theater . 
1	53	 They never attracted majority support for their antics , but they did n't have to . 
1	53	 All they had to do was provoke , offend the crew - cut crowd , generate outrage and set off a cycle that ripped apart the cultural consensus . 
1	53	 The late 1960s were a time of intense cultural conflict , which left a lot of wreckage in its wake . 
1	53	 But eventually a new establishment came into being , which we will call the meritocratic establishment . 
1	53	 These were the tame heirs to Hoffman and Rubin . 
1	53	 They were well educated . 
1	53	 They cut their moral teeth on the civil rights and feminist movements . 
1	53	 They embraced economic , social and moral individualism . 
1	53	 They came to dominate the institutions of American society on both left and right . 
1	53	 Hillary Clinton is part of this more educated cohort . 
1	53	 So are parts of the conservative establishment . 
1	53	 If you 're reading this newspaper , you probably are , too , as am I. 
1	53	 This establishment , too , has had its failures . 
1	53	 It created an economy that benefits itself and leaves everybody else out . 
1	53	 It led America into war in Iraq and sent the working class off to fight it . 
1	53	 It has developed its own brand of cultural snobbery . 
1	53	 Its media , film and music industries make members of the working class feel invisible and disrespected . 
1	53	 So in 2016 , members of the outraged working class elected their own Abbie Hoffman as president . 
1	53	 Trump is not good at much , but he is wickedly good at sticking his thumb in the eye of the educated elites . 
1	53	 He does n't have to build a new culture , or even attract a majority . 
1	53	 He just has to tear down the old one . 
1	53	 That 's exactly what he 's doing . 
1	53	 Donald Trump came into a segmenting culture and he is further tearing apart every fissure . 
1	53	 He has a nose for every wound in the body politic and day after day he sticks a red - hot poker in one wound or another and rips it open . 
1	53	 Day by day Trump is turning us into a nation of different planets . 
1	53	 Each planet feels more righteous about itself and is more isolated from and offended by the other planets . 
1	53	 The members of the educated class saw this past weekend 's NFL fracas as a fight over racism . 
1	53	 They felt mobilized and unified in that fight and full of righteous energy . 
1	53	 Members of the working class saw the fracas as a fight about American identity . 
1	53	 They saw Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin try to dissuade Alejandro Villanueva , a three - time combat veteran , from celebrating the flag he risked his life for . 
1	53	 Members of this class also felt mobilized , unified and full of righteous energy . 
1	53	 I do n't know which planet is bigger , or which would win an election , but that frankly does n't matter . 
1	53	 All that matters is that Trump is shredding the culture and ending the dominance of the meritocratic establishment . 
1	53	 He continually goes after racial matters in part because he 's a bigot but also in part because multiculturalism is the theology of the educated class and it 's the leverage point he can most effectively use to isolate the educated class from everyone else . 
1	53	 He is so destructive because his enemies help him . 
1	53	 He ramps up the aggression . 
1	53	 His enemies ramp it up more , to preserve their own dignity . 
1	53	 But the ensuing cultural violence only serves Trump 's long - term destructive purpose . 
1	53	 America is seeing nearly as much cultural conflict as it did in the late 1960s . 
1	53	 It 's quite possible that after four years of this Trump will have effectively destroyed the prevailing culture . 
1	53	 The reign of the meritocratic establishment will be just as over as the reign of the Protestant establishment now is . 
1	53	 Of course Donald Trump is a buffoon . 
1	53	 Buffoonery is his most effective weapon . 
1	53	 Because of him , a new culture will have to be built , new values promulgated and a new social fabric will have to be woven , one that brings the different planets back into relation with one another . 
1	53	 That 's the work of the next 20 years .David Brooks : The Abbie Hoffman of the Right : Donald Trump

1	55	The media 's reporting has now become one of the most central issues being covered by the media . 
1	55	 Trump 's fitness to serve is simply a piece of fake news that his enemies are using to relentlessly attack him . 
1	55	 The issues are not the central matters that concern Trump 's opponents - they just seem focused on one thing - bringing President Trump down - with no red lines as to how to achieve that goal . 
1	55	 Let 's hope political discourse takes a step upwards and we can return to discussing the main issues . 
1	55	 Some corners of the media seem to have totally lost focus on what their jobs are supposed to be . 
1	55	 The State of Israel is very used to this entire idea of fact inventing and fact - bending . 
1	55	 Just like Donald Trump has been saying , the New York times has been using headlines such as : 
1	55	" "" Ten die in PLO Fighting "" as far back as the 80 's . "
1	55	 Instead of reporting that warring Arab factions in Lebanon had killed other Arab factions in Lebanon , the clear implication was that the Israeli Army killed 10 more Arabs . 
1	55	 This was noted by US Ambassador to the UN , Jeane Kikpatrick . 
1	55	 The key aspect was not whether or not the news was fake or not , but whether or not the implication that the publications were hoping to get across would stick . 
1	55	 In the case of the New York Times , it was a clear anti - Israel bias that spread across ABS , NBC , and CBS during their War in Lebanon . 
1	55	 The bias against Israel has continued to this day and has been augmented by CNN 's slanted reporting . 
1	55	 Fox News is occasionally a breath of fresh air on Israel , but not always;. 
1	55	 So , when Donald Trump takes on the biased media with terms like fake news , it is a pleasure to see and watch the pompous anti - right wing media cringe . 
1	55	 Indeed , most of the mass media has completely lost it .

0	56	The NFL national anthem story is n't going away anytime soon . 
0	56	 During many debate shows that air on cable sports networks , it was topic one . 
0	56	 This was especially true during true during FS1 's Undisputed with Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe . 
0	56	 As the FS1 Dynamic Duo began discussing the topic , Sharpe went on an incredible eight - minute rant on how NFL owners suddenly got an awakening about President Trump 's comments at an Alabama rally about players who kneel during the national anthem . 
0	56	" Sharpe first said he was "" disappointed and … unimpressed , "" about the whole thing . "
0	56	 And then he expressed why he was disappointed and unimpressed : 
0	56	" "" I 'm disappointed , Skip and Joy , because this is the tipping point . "
0	56	 Of the 7,537 things that President Trump has said in the last 50 years , him calling an NFL player a ‘ SOB ' is what brought the NFL , the owners and players together . 
0	56	 And while some might be moved by the conscience of these NFL owners , it was n't their conscience that moved them . 
0	56	 It was the cash . 
0	56	 Because see Skip , what we know about people with money , they do n't like to be told what to do … they do n't like being bullied . 
0	56	" You see , President Trump has bullied a lot of people … "" "
0	56	" Sharpe then mentioned Trump 's comments on Mexico , attacking a Gold Star family after last year 's Democratic National Convention , and his statements to former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush about women saying , "" that did not shock the conscience of NFL owners . "" "
0	56	 And he also pointed out a number of owners , including Jerry Jones , Daniel Snyder , Shad Khan , and Robert Kraft , who contributed to Trump 's inauguration . 
0	56	" "" Now I 'm unimpressed because this was n't a protest . "
0	56	 This was unity . 
0	56	 So what are we showing solidarity against , Skip ? 
0	56	 We 're showing solidarity because President Trump .. he challenged the very men … wealthy , wealthy men … billionaires and he told them what you should do if someone protests , you should fire them . 
0	56	 They do n't like being told what to do , Skip . 
0	56	" "" And then , Skip , he called players that protested the anthem … he called them ‘ SOB 's . ' "
0	56	 Think about that now , he called them ‘ SOB 's . ' 
0	56	 That 's what got the owners , that 's what got the players to unite . 
0	56	" "" Is that the worst that he 's ever said ? "
0	56	 Absolutely not . 
0	56	" Never called Vladimir Putin an ‘ SOB , ' Never called ( Erdogan ) of Turkey an ‘ SOB , ' even those men that walked down the streets in Charlottesville , Virginia … he never said ‘ SOB ' … "" "
0	56	 This was an impassioned Sharpe . 
0	56	" He also pointed out Colin Kaepernick , who started the kneeling during the national anthem , was forgotten and the NFL owners were uniting against Donald Trump . "" "
0	56	" It was n't until he came for the NFL that their conscience was shocked ! "" "
0	56	 Sharpe said of all the teams that issued statements this weekend , only the Seattle Seahawks got the reason why they were denouncing the President 's statements . 
0	56	 And he also set his sights on fellow FS1 analyst Ray Lewis for previously criticizing Kaepernick and then kneeling on the sideline with the Baltimore Ravens in London on Sunday . 
0	56	" Sharpe said he was "" very disappointed "" in him , saying Lewis "" sat in that chair right there saying that he could never kneel , never not stand for the national anthem "" citing those who died fighting for the flag and then he went down on both knees . "" "
0	56	" What are you kneeling for ? "" "
0	56	" It was one of the more emotional segments on Undisputed in its brief history .Shannon Sharpe goes after NFL owners ' hypocrisy over "" unity """

1	58	Only hours after President Donald Trump 's aide , Kellyanne Conway , had a fiery exchange with CNN 's Chris Cuomo over whether or not the White House was obsessed about Hillary Clinton , the president completely undercut her argument . 
1	58	" On Thursday morning , the president , spending his "" Executive Time "" watching "" Fox & Friends , "" angrily tweeted about his Democratic opponent in 2016 , while slamming the infamous dossier in an attempt to distract from the ongoing probe by special counsel Robert Mueller into the Trump campaign 's alleged ties to the Kremlin . "
1	58	" Disproven and paid for by Democrats "" Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign . "
1	58	" Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election ? "" "
1	58	 @foxandfriends Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians ? 
1	58	 Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers ? 
1	58	 Where are Crooked Hillary Emails ? 
1	58	 What a mess ! 
1	58	 — Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) January 11 , 2018 
1	58	 But just the night before , Conway vociferously defended Trump and insisted no one in the White House cared about Clinton . 
1	58	" "" We do n't care about her . "
1	58	" Nobody here talks about her , "" Conway said . "" "
1	58	" Nobody here talks about Hillary Clinton , I promise you . "" "
1	58	" "" We do n't care about her . "
1	58	" Nobody here talks about her . "" "
1	58	 Kellyanne Conway claimed that while many can not get over the 2016 presidential election , the White House does not talk about Hillary Clinton . 
1	58	 https://t.co/VvVVbeeLyK pic.twitter.com/W73q9nZnF5 
1	58	 — CNN ( @CNN ) January 11 , 2018 
1	58	 Conway also asserted that the public still had not gotten over the election and that most have n't moved on . 
1	58	 Trump , however , was handing out electoral maps last year touting his victory . 
1	58	" "" So many people ca n't get over the election results , "" Conway said . "
1	58	" Cuomo fired back , "" Says my friend who ca n't keep Hillary Clinton 's name out of her mouth . "" "
1	58	" "" I 'll make you a deal , "" Conway said . "" "
1	58	" I 'll never talk about her [ Clinton ] again , but then you ca n't talk about the 2016 election . "" "
1	58	" "" I 'm not , I have n't mentioned the election once , "" Cuomo replied . "
1	58	 In recent months , Conway has tweeted about Clinton on numerous occasions herself . 
1	58	 It took Hillary abt 5 minutes to blame NRA for madman 's rampage , but 5 days to sorta - kinda blame Harvey Weinstein 4 his sexually assaults . 
1	58	 — Kellyanne Conway ( @KellyannePolls ) October 10 , 2017 
1	58	" So , Hillary blames Bernie 4 Trump 's "" Crooked Hillary "" , blames Obama 4 "" lay off Bernie "" , blames Bernie Bros 4 sexism . "
1	58	 https://t.co/6MjMmc3q8m 
1	58	 — Kellyanne Conway ( @KellyannePolls ) September 5 , 2017 
1	58	 The two continued to talk over each other , and Cuomo brought up the alleged Russian election meddling , as well as the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting in which top Trump campaign officials met with a Russian lawyer with potential ties to the Kremlin in order to receive dirt on Clinton . 
1	58	" "" The idea that we would have to look any further than Hillary Clinton to beat Hillary Clinton is a fantasy , "" Conway said . "
1	58	" The CNN host added , "" Is we inconclusive of Don Jr. , Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort , who went to a meeting with a Russian lawyer who was promising dirt on Hillary Clinton ? "" "
1	58	" "" And what came of that meeting ? "
1	58	" Absolutely nothing , "" Conway responded . "
1	58	" "" That 's not the point , "" Cuomo emphasized . "" "
1	58	" The point is why you went . "" "
1	58	 In essence , Conway 's behavior was a larger metaphor of the Trump presidency . 
1	58	" Either Conway — who delivered to America the phrase "" alternative facts "" — was deliberately lying about Trump 's personal obsession with deflecting and pointing the finger at Clinton , or she has proven yet again that the right hand still has truly no idea what the left is doing . "
1	58	 The exchange did n't end on television , though , continuing on Twitter Thursday morning . 
1	58	" So fun to see the predictable heads exploding , but I should 've finished that sentence # CuomoPrimeTime @CNN . "" "
1	58	" Nobody in the White House talks about Hillary Clinton "" when noting whose presidential leadership = historic tax cuts & economic boom , reg reform , put ISIS in retreat . "

1	59	 The problem is that the Democrats have something going for them that those on the other side simply do n't seem to be able to do . 
1	59	 They know their enemy . 
1	59	 They know how to manipulate the Republicans in office to give the left everything they want .  
1	59	 The military taught me at an early age that one must know their enemy . 
1	59	 This adage does not simply pertain to combat either . 
1	59	 In all facets of your life , you must always endeavor to see things from the perspective of others . 
1	59	 Not only does this allow you to empathize with them , but it also shows you the way to gain the tactical advantage . 
1	59	 The greatest pundit of this would have to be Sun Tzu , an ancient Chinese warlord who wrote the book The Art of War . 
1	59	 This book is one of the best books on strategy ever written . 
1	59	 This strategy goes far beyond the confines of combat , however . 
1	59	 He spends a great deal of time discussing how war is mostly a mental game , explaining that force is simply one facet within an expansive set of options . 
1	59	" One of my favorite quotes is , "" If you know the enemy and know yourself , you need not fear the result of a hundred battles . "
1	59	 If you know yourself but not the enemy , for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat . 
1	59	" If you know neither the enemy nor yourself , you will succumb in every battle . "" "
1	59	 I do this very well . 
1	59	 In fact , I do it too well . 
1	59	 Just ask my wife . 
1	59	 I know how I argue and I know how she argues , and I use this knowledge to my advantage every time . 
1	59	 It is not intentional at this point , just something that has been ingrained into me . 
1	59	 So at the end of the day , I can respect an adversary who is capable of truly manipulating a situation to gain the psychological advantage . 
1	59	 It is for this reason that I must tip my hat to the Democratic party as a whole . 
1	59	 I try very hard to be honest regardless of which side of the political aisle you may be on . 
1	59	 When someone does something wrong , I will call them out for it . 
1	59	 Typically , this is very easy to do with the Democrats , as virtually everything about their platform goes against what I believe the Constitution stands for . 
1	59	 With that being said , I must also recognize when my enemy is gaining the advantage through manipulation ; while I may not agree with their methods , I have to respect and be impressed with their results . 
1	59	 Consider this — the Democrats have for the past eight years seen a huge loss in political power . 
1	59	 According to Fox News , the total loss of Democrat - held elected positions as of December 2016 was 1,042 . 
1	59	 In fact , during the Obama reign , they went from 55 to 46 Senate seats and from 256 to 194 House seats at the federal level . 
1	59	 Things did n't improve at the state level , with the number of Democratic governors going from 28 to 16 and a total loss of 958 legislative seats . 
1	59	 No compatible source was found for this video . 
1	59	 There is only one way to look at these numbers — a complete and total repudiation of liberal policies and beliefs . 
1	59	 What made this even funnier at the time was how the Democrats then doubled down on their divisiveness . 
1	59	" A great example is when Sally Brown , DNC Chair hopeful , stated that , "" My job is to listen and be a voice and shut other white people down when they want to interrupt … We have to teach [ others ] how to communicate , how to be sensitive and how to shut their mouths if they are white . "" "
1	59	 Or even when Howard Dean said that hate speech was n't protected speech . 
1	59	 My favorite , though , was when Tom Perez , Democratic National Committee chair , said that if you wanted to be a Democrat , you had to be pro - choice . 
1	59	 However , what was originally funny to me quickly curdled into shock . 
1	59	 The problem is that the Democrats have something going for them that those on the other side simply do n't seem to be able to do . 
1	59	 They know their enemy . 
1	59	 They know how to manipulate the Republicans in office to give the left everything they want . 
1	59	 I would never have believed that this was possible . 
1	59	 The Republicans own both houses of Congress and had the overwhelming support of the American people . 
1	59	 They were elected into office to enact the items that they ran on : defunding planned parenthood , repealing Obamacare , enacting tax reform , and building a wall . 
1	59	 What did they accomplish out of that ? 
1	59	 Nothing ! 
1	59	 To make it even worse , they showed their incompetence by releasing Obamacare version 2.0 . 
1	59	 How is it possible for a party to have the majority control at both the state and national levels and yet not be able to enact the very legislation that it ran on ? 
1	59	 The answer to that is the Democratic party . 
1	59	 Not only were they able to keep the Republicans from moving on their platform , they now get to pass the buck on the failure of Obamacare to the Republicans . 
1	59	 Now , in a continuing show of their exceptional ability to control the government even when not in power , they have managed to have special council appointed to look into the Russian involvement in the election cycle . 
1	59	 This ensures that even though there has been no evidence to suggest that the Trump administration did anything illegal , the question remains front and center over his presidency . 
1	59	 They were even able to avoid the same scrutiny within their own party , where there were a plethora of potentially illegal actions that were swept under the rug . 
1	59	 I hate to say it , but my hat is off to you , Democratic party . 
1	59	 You have managed to ensure the catastrophic collapse of the party who won control of the country due to your failed policies . 
1	59	 So how is it possible that they were able to do this ? 
1	59	 The answer is simply that they actually believe in their cause . 
1	59	 This has both helped and hurt them . 
1	59	 Wanting an America with less freedom and constricted liberties does not sell well . 
1	59	 At the end of the day , there is only so much crazy talk the populace can endure without finally shutting you down . 
1	59	 However , when you truly believe in your cause , the elected posts are secondary to what your message is . 
1	59	 This is not true for the Republicans , who clearly covet power over the interest of the country . 
1	59	 They are so worried about keeping their control that they would turn on their own principals to protect themselves . 
1	59	 Knowing this allows the left to continue to move their position and policies forward , even when not in power , and the right is doing the same thing that they always do . 
1	59	 They are sitting by and watching out of fear that they will be blamed . 
1	59	 The typical Republican politician is clearly not capable of real leadership . 
1	59	 Real leadership inspires those around them and rallies them under a single banner . 
1	59	 The sad thing is that in this case , this was the banner that the American people elected their officials to turn into reality . 
1	59	 If the Republicans do not figure this out quickly , they are setting themselves up for more than just a loss . 
1	59	 They are looking at a complete shakeup of their party . 
1	59	 Maybe that is what is needed , though . 
1	59	 Maybe this is actually for the best . 
1	59	 I remember right before retiring telling my son that there comes a point in every career when you are no longer able to bend and adapt . 
1	59	 You have grown too complacent in your ways and view new ideas and thoughts as a threat to your existence . 
1	59	 It is at this point that you have become the dinosaur . 
1	59	 I am pretty sure that at this point , what the party needs is an extinction - level event , and the Democrats are more than willing to lead us to that well .Sun Tzu and the Democratic Party
0	60	Sex - trafficking is happening in nearly every city and in every state in the U.S. 
0	60	 In an all - new Crime Watch Daily in - depth investigation , we take you inside the epidemic that has exploded in recent years . 
0	60	 Human trafficking is defined in the simplest terms as the exploitation of another person through force , fraud or coercion . 
0	60	 The average age of trafficking victims entering the sex trade world is 13 years old . 
0	60	 According to Mary Mazzio 's documentary I Am Jane Doe , there are more than 1.6 million homeless or runaway kids on the streets of America , and up to 15 percent of them have fallen victim to sex - trafficking . 
0	60	" "" That 's hundreds of thousands of children every day , and that 's only the homeless and runaway population , "" said Mazzio . "
0	60	 HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN LOS ANGELES 
0	60	 Crime Watch Daily rode along with a group of undercover deputies from the L.A. County Sheriff 's Department as they busted men looking to hook up with underage girls . 
0	60	 TRAFFICKING IN HOUSTON 
0	60	 In Houston , Texas , one woman is tackling the problem from a very different angle . 
0	60	 She 's not a sex worker -- not anymore . 
0	60	" "" I know what it 's like to be more afraid to go home than you are to get in a car with a stranger , "" said former trafficking victim Rebecca Bender . "
0	60	 Bender become a victim for nearly six years , traded between three different traffickers in all . 
0	60	 She says it was only after police busted her trafficker for tax evasion that she was able to finally break free . 
0	60	 But it would take years to get her life back on track . 
0	60	 After a decade free from the life , Rebecca Bender is about to go back on the streets , posing as a sex worker to expose just how big the problem may be in your town . 
0	60	 TRAFFICKING DELUNA 
0	60	 Much like the heroin epidemic we are now facing , sex - trafficking is a massive problem in the United States . 
0	60	 These are not just women being brought in from other countries . 
0	60	 We 're talking about teens , or even younger , being recruited from middle schools and high schools in just about every city in America . 
0	60	 So far we 've taken you undercover on sex - trafficking stings and you 've see some cities that have become sex - slave hubs . 
0	60	 Crime Watch Daily interviews a young woman lured into the sex - trade world and how it 's now landed her in prison doing serious time . 
0	60	 Lizette Deluna ran from abuse at home into the arms of a sex - trafficker . 
0	60	 Now she 's in prison in Texas , convicted of trafficking herself . 
0	60	 How did she get there ? 
0	60	 She share her journey exclusively with Crime Watch Daily . 
0	60	 TRAFFICKING IN DEKALB COUNTY 
0	60	 Crime Watch Daily teams up with law enforcement agencies all over the country who are cracking down on the illegal sex trade business . 
0	60	 On the streets of Georgia , we encountered an alleged pimp that was more than happy to talk to us . 
0	60	 TARGETING ONLINE CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING 
0	60	 No matter where we went , there seemed to be one name that kept coming up : Backpage.com . 
0	60	 Operating in more than 900 cities worldwide , the online classifieds website commands , by some estimates , more than 80 percent of all online sex ad revenues . 
0	60	 And it 's through those ads that many allege the company has knowingly permitted the sale of underage children . 
0	60	" "" The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has stated that at least 73 percent of all reports to them , of online sex trafficking , where does it happen ? "
0	60	" Backpage.com , "" said I Am Jane Doe filmmaker Mary Mazzio . "
0	60	 Just recently , under pressure from the U.S. Senate , Backpage did shut down its adult section in the United States . 
0	60	 The company itself may be worth more than $ 500 million , and by some estimates , 99 percent of that global income comes from illicit ads . 
0	60	 For their part , Backpage claims no responsibility for what they call third - party content . 
0	60	 But in a series of new civil suits brought by former victims , attorney Erik Bauer claims Backpage actually helped edit the ads to make them appear more legitimate . 
0	60	 Not long ago , Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer , along with former owners Michael Lacey and James Larkin were actually brought up on pimping charges by former California Attorney General and current U.S. Senator Kamala Harris . 
0	60	 Crime Watch Daily Correspondent Melissa McCarty was there during their latest arraignment . 
0	60	 They ignored our questions , but considering the serious nature of the charges , we had to keep trying . 
0	60	 Is freedom of speech more important than protecting children being forced into prostitution ? 
0	60	 Is there some type of moral responsibility that technology companies and CEOs have ? 
0	60	 No comment from the men or their attorneys . 
0	60	 The judge granted Crime Watch Daily exclusive access inside the courtroom for the proceedings , where ultimately the defense requested a delay . 
0	60	 While they wait for the next hearing , Carl Ferrer is released on a $ 500,000 bond , while Larkin and Lacey get out on $ 250,000 bonds . 
0	60	" "" We have lost all common sense , "" said Mary Mazzio . "" "
0	60	 If you had a site that said ' Murder for Hire , ' do you seriously think the American public would stand for that , that a federal jurist would stand for that ? 
0	60	" But because it 's prostitution , it 's ' Pretty Woman , ' it 's the victimless crime , it 's the world 's oldest profession , you know what -- not that big of a deal . "" "
0	60	 So is there a solution ? 
0	60	 Can awareness alone help stop the problem ? 
0	60	 And just how many more lives will be stolen for sex ?

1	63	Steve Bannon is on the warpath , continuing his mission to drain the swamp . 
1	63	 This is hardly a new revelation . 
1	63	 Long before President Trump was a glint in the Tea Party 's eye , the Breitbart News chairman was hard at work laying the foundation to what would be a dominating force in Republican politics at the intersection of Conservatism , Libertarianism and Populism - promoting the likes of Sarah Palin , Ted Cruz and Rand Paul to national prominence . 
1	63	 The former Chief White House Strategist is fresh off stumping for firebrand jurist Roy Moore , who claimed a decisive victory against Sen. Luther Strange - a swamp varmint appointed under dubious circumstances to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions ' vacated Alabama Senate seat . 
1	63	 Bannon 's influence in the Alabama blowout has many wondering what 's next for the populist rabble - rouser . 
1	63	 CNN 's Dana Bash reports the political tactician is setting his sights on the 2018 midterms , crisscrossing the country in search of populist candidates to remake the Republican Party , and blackballing swamp creatures who refuse to be drained . 
1	63	 From CNN : 
1	63	" "" The populist movement is going to do a house cleaning of all those individuals that made a living off the conservative grassroots while stabbing them in the back , "" a source familiar with Bannon 's thinking tells CNN . "
1	63	 Bannon is beginning that effort by trying to blackball GOP campaign strategist Jeff Roe , who worked for Sen. Luther Strange , who lost Tuesday 's primary to Roy Moore . 
1	63	 Bannon is spreading the word that he believes Roe is responsible for dirty tactics against Moore , and alleging that Roe worked with President Donald Trump 's son - in - law and White House adviser Jared Kushner to mislead Trump about the state of the race in Alabama in and around Trump 's endorsement of Strange . 
1	63	 [ … ] 
1	63	" Following his speech at Moore 's victory rally Tuesday night where Bannon credited "" the people "" with the victory , he vowed to help the populist wing of the GOP win other Senate battles in 2018 . "
1	63	 To that end , he flew from Alabama to Colorado to begin recruiting western candidates to run against Republican incumbents … . 
1	63	 Bannon also plans to head back down south to have meetings with those who may want to run in Tennessee for the seat Sen. Bob Corker announced he will vacate , and in Mississippi , to challenge sitting Republican Sen. Roger Wicker . 
1	63	 Bannon 's rage against crony capitalism has already electrified the base , striking fear in the hearts of the ivory tower establishment who have enriched themselves on the backs of average Americans . 
1	63	 As a former Goldman Sachs banker who grew disillusioned with their strong - arm tactics , Bannon witnessed the decimation of the working middle class , as Wall St. firms facilitated the largest betrayal of Americans in history while creating a looming debt bubble which could still lead to systemic collapse . 
1	63	 Bannon 's unique purview of high - level greed is potent , and his disgust towards establishment is fueled in large part by the incestuous revolving door between DC and Wall Street . 
1	63	 Bannon witnessed first hand how Goldman Sachs , once a monastery to the ambitious investment banker , became The Black House . 
1	63	 As President Trump and Steve Bannon , two of the Right 's most influential figures today continue to remake the Republican Party , an important question arises ; In whose image will the future of the Conservative movement be cast ? 
1	63	 At first glance , Trumpism and Bannonism bear many similarities . 
1	63	 Rooted in right - wing populism and traditionalism alike , both ideologies seek to shift the center of power from Corporate America back to the American worker . 
1	63	 Both men believe the elite have benefited disproportionately from globalization , while hallowing out a once prosperous middle class in the process . 
1	63	 And both Trump and Bannon have furiously railed against a swamp that has profited handsomely from endless spillage of blood and treasure abroad , while cities at home suffer from racial and economic tensions stoked by the Obama administration . 
1	63	 In short , both Trump and Bannon see that the world is suffering from systemic division orchestrated at the highest levels , and Western cultures are actively being destroyed under the false pretense of humanitarianism and open - border politics . 
1	63	 Finally , in order to preserve America 's borders , language and culture , both men believe an impenetrable wall must be built to prevent illegal aliens from breaching the nation 's geography . 
1	63	 That 's where the similarities between Trumpism and Bannonism end . 
1	63	 A key difference , if not the difference between Trump and his former chief strategist , is the President 's penchant for compromise and dealmaking , while Bannon is far less malleable in his beliefs . 
1	63	 Where Trumpism fails the ideological purity test - which risks alienating his base , Bannonism is brimming with the very civic nationalism that led to Trump 's win . 
1	63	 Herein lies the rub for Trump voters - the commander - in - chief has demonstrated a very ‘ swamp - like ' flexibility on matters ranging from healthcare to immigration , leaving Trump 's most oft - repeated campaign promises on the cutting room floor . 
1	63	 In September , for example , President Trump shocked Washington by announcing a tentative framework to work with Democratic leadership on DACA and the looming budget crisis . 
1	63	 Washington Times reports : 
1	63	 President Trump and Democratic leaders on Wednesday did what Washington does best : striking a bipartisan deal to boost borrowing and spending , keeping the government running into the next fiscal year and speeding disaster relief to Texas and Florida . 
1	63	 Mr. Trump accepted the deal offered by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer at a White House meeting , seeing it as a chance to get ahead of a series of pressing fiscal problems that needed to be fixed this month . 
1	63	" But the agreement blindsided Republican leaders , including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan , who just hours earlier called Democrats ' proposal "" ridiculous and disgraceful . "" "
1	63	" For some reason , however , Trump 's most vocal opponents on the right did n't seem to be caught off guard by his "" deal , "" with a smirking Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi , as ‘ Never - Trumpers ' have long warned that the President was nothing more than a chameleon who could n't be trusted to prosecute the Republican agenda . "
1	63	 According to Schumer , President Trump even suggested against building the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico - a move which would be seen by Trump 's loyal base as the ultimate betrayal . 
1	63	 Breitbart News reports : 
1	63	" This week on the "" Pod Save America "" podcast , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) detailed the debt ceiling and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) policy negotiations he had with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) and President Donald Trump earlier in the month . "
1	63	" Schumer said , "" On DREAMers , he said , you know , that he understood that they did n't come in through any fault of their own , that they 're good Americans , good kids . "
1	63	 And then he said he wants the wall in return . 
1	63	 And we said ‘ No . 
1	63	 No wall , Mr. President . ' 
1	63	" And he tried that for about 15 minutes , but he 's not going to push me around verbally or any other way . "" "
1	63	" He added , "" And he finally said , "" OK , we wo n't do the wall . "
1	63	" We 'll do some other kind of border security . "" "
1	63	 Was such an offer ever made by Trump ? 
1	63	 One may never know , and thus exists the problem . 
1	63	 Under Bannon 's more hard - line economic nationalism , claims of Trump wavering would have been branded as nothing more than propaganda from the left . 
1	63	 Instead , an increasingly malleable Trump is disappointing even his most ardent supporters . 
1	63	 Bannon 's endgame 
1	63	 Steve Bannon 's refusal to bend the knee to deep - state establishmentarians would betray his mission ; elect enough Populist Conservatives to Congress to successfully implement the MAGA agenda in earnest - reshaping the country to such a degree that even if a Democrat manages to win the presidency , Populism and Economic Nationalism continue to dominate the political spectrum - restoring faith in government among the abandoned middle class . 
1	63	 Bannonism , by its very nature , views compromise with the establishment as a last resort . 
1	63	 This approach appeals to Trump 's base , who went to the polling booths to actively resist threats to National Security , the economy , and the American way of life . 
1	63	 Alas , it 's clear that the desires of American conservatives have fallen on tone - deaf ears . 
1	63	 One need look no further than the Alabama Senate race - which saw Trump flagrantly abandon his base by supporting deep - state candidate Luther Strange over Bannon - supported economic nationalist Roy Moore . 
1	63	 And instead of rallying behind the MAGA candidate , traditionally pro - establishment conservative outlets were more concerned with optics than substance . 
1	63	 National Review 's Reihan Salam , for example , seemed to be disproportionately concerned that Moore would provide CNN with endless soundbytes and fodder . 
1	63	" "" When I look at Roy Moore , I see someone who is clearly apocalyptic , and I do n't see anything else to him , and I think that it 's bad news for the GOP . "
1	63	" It 's great , great news for CNN , the Washington Post and every big mainstream news media outlet that will cover every single one of his utterances , "" complained Salam in the latest edition of The Editors , a podcast led by National Review 's Charles C.W. Cooke and Rich Lowry . "
1	63	 The concern is embryonic of the neurosis plaguing the establishment ( and like it or not , a powerful subset of the Conservative movement ) . 
1	63	 They actually care what the talking heads on CNN think . 
1	63	 Meanwhile , every - day American conservatives have stopped trusting the Very Fake News network . 
1	63	 Perhaps it 's high time Republican elites follow suit .

0	64	" President Donald Trump said Wednesday that former FBI Director James Comey "" lied and leaked "" information and ultimately protected Hillary Clinton , while also questioning the credibility of the FBI 's probe into her email . "
0	64	 Trump 's early morning tweets come in the wake of news that the bureau 's former director had drafted a statement exonerating Clinton before the investigation was over . 
0	64	" "" Wow , FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete . "
0	64	" Many people not interviewed , including Clinton herself , "" Trump wrote on Twitter . "" "
0	64	 Comey stated under oath that he did n't do this - obviously a fix ? 
0	64	" Where is Justice Dept ? "" "
0	64	" "" As it has turned out , James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton . "
0	64	" He was the best thing that ever happened to her ! "" "
0	64	 the president added later . 
0	64	" Newsweek reported Monday on documents released by the FBI that included an email sent on May 2 , 2016 , by Comey to other FBI officials that included a file titled "" Drafts of Director Comeys July 5 , 2016 Statement Regarding Email Server Investigation Part 01 of 01 . "" "
0	64	 Despite Comey having already drafted a statement on the investigation into Clinton 's email practices while at the State Department , the probe would continue on for months . 
0	64	 Clinton herself was not interviewed until July 2 , 2016 , three days before Comey held a press conference to announce that the FBI would not recommend filing charges against the former secretary of state . 
0	64	" That Comey had drafted a statement exonerating Clinton with months to go before the completion of the investigation has raised concern among Republicans on Capitol Hill , including Senators Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) and Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , who wrote a letter to current FBI Director Christopher Wray noting that "" the outcome of an investigation should not be prejudged while FBI agents are still hard at work trying to gather the facts . "" "
0	64	 While the president has complained that Comey was too easy on Clinton , the former secretary of state has made no secret that she believes it was Comey 's late October 2016 , announcement that the bureau was examining potentially fresh evidence related to the email investigation that cost her the election . 
0	64	 The evidence examined by the bureau came up fruitless , but Clinton has complained that the resurfacing of the scandal so close to Election Day reintroduced doubt into voters ' minds . 
0	64	 Trump , who reveled in the bureau 's investigation into Clinton throughout the campaign , fired Comey last May , a move the White House initially said was based on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein 's assessment of Comey 's handling of the Clinton investigation . 
0	64	 Trump later conceded that he had already made his mind up to fire Comey before receiving Rosenstein 's recommendation and that he had made the decision with the FBI 's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election weighing on his mind .Trump : Comey ‘ lied and leaked ' and protected Clinton
1	65	What happened Sunday night in Las Vegas was a horrible , senseless tragedy . 
1	65	 Hundreds are hurt , at least 58 dead as of this writing , and a nation trying to figure out just what is going on . 
1	65	 Here 's a video of the concert as the attack begins : 
1	65	 — Luke Broadlick ( @LukeBroadlick ) October 2 , 2017 
1	65	 Note the sound . 
1	65	 Sure sounds like a fully - automatic weapon which is one of the most tightly controlled weapon categories in the country . 
1	65	 A background check , permission from law enforcement , and national registration are just some of the hurdles one would have to go through to buy a weapon like this legally . 
1	65	 That does n't even touch on the massive expense of buying a legal full - auto firearm following the 1986 machine gun ban . 
1	65	 Weapons like that run tens of thousands of dollars , which means that alone keeps them out of most folks ' hands . 
1	65	 But that wo n't stop the anti - gun left . 
1	65	 Nope . 
1	65	 Blame for the tragedy rest squarely on the shoulders of the National Rifle Association . 
1	65	 The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots . 
1	65	 Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer , which the NRA wants to make easier to get . 
1	65	 — Hillary Clinton ( @HillaryClinton ) October 2 , 2017 
1	65	 Oh , sweet and fluffy Lord . 
1	65	 It 's a suppressor , not a silencer . 
1	65	 For the kinds of weapons we 're looking at being used , a suppressor is less than useless . 
1	65	 Further , if the shooter got a legal full - auto weapon , which is doubtful , it would n't have been a problem for him to get a suppressor . 
1	65	 If he got the weapons illegally , then there was nothing stopping him from getting a suppressor illegally . 
1	65	 Nothing was done after Sandy Hook , Orlando and now Las Vegas . 
1	65	 Stop kidding yourselves @NRA civilians owning machine guns is a VERY BAD IDEA . 
1	65	 — Ollie Cookson ( @OCookson ) October 2 , 2017

1	65	 Really , it keeps going on and on like that .

1	65	" This from the same people who routinely call for calm reflection following a terrorist attack motivated by radical Islam . "" "
1	65	" Do n't blame all of Islam , "" they say … but think nothing of blaming the NRA for something there 's no indication they had anything to do with . "
1	65	 Let me make this very clear to the leftists out there : This maniac used one of the most tightly controlled and regulated firearms in the country , one that requires every hoop imaginable to get your hands on legally , and killed dozens and wounded hundreds . 
1	65	 Do you really think there 's anything that would have stopped this from happening ? 
1	65	 Anything at all ? 
1	65	 Especially since there are so many questions we do n't have answers to . 
1	65	 His brother claims he had no political affiliations , but that seems unlikely in this day and age . 
1	65	 However , we still do n't know for sure . 
1	65	 Maybe he was an odd duck these days and did n't care . 
1	65	 Who knows . 
1	65	 To be sure , there 's plenty of speculation going on . 
1	65	 I 'm not immune to it , though I wo n't divulge my speculation publicly just now . 
1	65	 However , speculation is just something people do to pass the time until we have actual facts , which are severely lacking at the moment . 
1	65	 What matters right now is to do whatever we can to help those who have been hurt by this tragedy , either by losing someone they care about , physically wounded in the assault , or legitimately traumatized by what they 've been through . 
1	65	 There are victims here , and they need our love and support far more than our wild theories about what has taken place in Las Vegas . 
1	65	 My heart and prayers go out to all the victims and their families , as do my wife 's and children 's .

1	66	LOS ANGELES , September 29 , 2017 — Since everything in America from the National Football League to Dr. Seuss has now been politicized , why let Yom Kippur be free of politics ? 
1	66	 The Jewish day of atonement is supposed to be about looking inward and admitting wrongs committed . 
1	66	 Yom Kippur involves asking for forgiveness and vowing to do right by those we have wronged . 
1	66	 It should be about personal growth , not politics . 
1	66	 Forget it . 
1	66	 Politically liberal Jews have spent decades issuing scorching indictments of all things Republican . 
1	66	 If it is a Republican , attack it . 
1	66	 If it is a conservative , despise it . 
1	66	 If it is President Donald Trump , vow to drive it from the face of the earth . 
1	66	 Why bother engaging in the Yom Kippur ritual if the prayers are hollow and insincere ? 
1	66	 Why bother vowing to be kinder only to return to vicious ideological bigotry the next day ? 
1	66	 Not all liberal Jews are ideological bigots . 
1	66	 Some of them are the kindest people walking the planet . 
1	66	 That rings as hollow to many people as saying that not all NFL players are desecrating the American flag . 
1	66	 When you belong to a group , you get the benefits and drawbacks of that group . 
1	66	 Politically liberal Jews have gone from being an oppressed people to being the very bullies they used to fear . 
1	66	 Liberal synagogues are frequently nothing but extensions of Democrat Party headquarters . 
1	66	 Since Yom Kippur is supposed to challenge Jews , a real challenge for liberal Jews is in order . 
1	66	 They can apologize for every single intolerant word they ever sad about Republicans conservatives and President Trump . 
1	66	 They can apologize for refusing to accept that Republicans have a right to win elections , and then govern in a conservative manner . 
1	66	 Acknowledge that Republicans are human beings . 
1	66	 Admit that Trump is not Adolf Hitler , and all comparisons of any American to Nazis , fascists , and brownshirts are statements to be disavowed . 
1	66	 Admit that the father of Orthodox Jew Ivanka Trump is not an anti - Semite . 
1	66	 Saying this is tough enough . 
1	66	 Meaning a single word of it is even tougher . 
1	66	 Yom Kippur should be based on Torah , the Old Testament . 
1	66	 The Torah is non - partisan . 
1	66	 Not one word of Torah justifies a politically liberal position on climate change , abortion , gay marriage , or any other hot button social issue . 
1	66	 If it did , many Orthodox Jews who vote Republican and spend their entire lives reading Torah would be heretics . 
1	66	 Liberal Jews may believe this , but they would be as wrong as they are about most things driven by emotion rather than data . 
1	66	 Far too many liberal Jews spend 364 days every year demonizing Republicans for existing and breathing air .

1	68	Governor Cuomo of New York is threatening to sue the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to stop its ongoing raids to detain illegal immigrants wanted for serious crimes like assault and rape . 
1	68	 A staggering 80 % of those apprehended in recent ICE raids in New York were either convicted criminals or charged with crimes . 
1	68	 But Mr. Cuomo is siding with criminals over their victims . 
1	68	 He 's playing politics . 
1	68	 Faced with a challenge on his left flank from Cynthia Nixon , he 's desperate to prove his liberal bona fides . 
1	68	 Public safety be damned . 
1	68	 The governor is parroting Democrats across the nation who claim ICE should be abolished because it 's breaking apart families and peaceful communities . 
1	68	 The facts prove otherwise . 
1	68	 Eighty - eight percent of the illegal immigrants arrested in recent Los Angeles ICE raids and 81 % arrested throughout California , according to the latest ICE data , had criminal convictions . 
1	68	 These are bad guys . 
1	68	" So when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi claims that "" unjust and cruel "" ICE raids "" terrorize innocent immigrant families , "" do n't buy it . "
1	68	 Mr. Cuomo is making the same bogus claim . 
1	68	 Last Thursday , the governor denounced an ICE raid on an Upstate farm looking for Marcial DeLeon - Aguilar , a three - time deportee convicted for felony aggravated assault . 
1	68	 Mr. Cuomo complained that Aguilar 's children had to watch their father being pinned by officers to block his escape . 
1	68	 What about families victimized by violent illegals ? 
1	68	 Since January 2016 , at least 25 Long Island youths have been executed by the MS-13 gang of Central American illegals . 
1	68	 Some of the victims were left so mutilated they could hardly be identified . 
1	68	 MS-13 beats the youngsters with baseball bats , puts plastic bags over their heads to suffocate them and then slices off their noses , ears and lips with machetes . 
1	68	 No one reads these victims their constitutional rights . 
1	68	 ICE 's Operation Matador targets MS-13 gang members . 
1	68	 Yet Mr. Cuomo seems angrier at the ICE agents than at the MS-13 butchers . 
1	68	" Laughably , Mr. Cuomo issued a "" cease and desist "" letter to ICE last week , ordering federal agents to touch base with local police before taking enforcement action . "
1	68	 Mr. Cuomo does n't have a leg on which to stand . 
1	68	 Check the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution : Uncle Sam does n't need Andrew Cuomo 's permission to enforce federal laws . 
1	68	 Why the surge in visible , violent sweeps ? 
1	68	 ICE is forced to conduct sweeps out in residential communities because New York 's sanctuary laws are preventing the agency from taking custody of criminal aliens before they 're released from jail , like the agency used to do . 
1	68	 As ICE 's Deputy Director Thomas Homan points out , these sanctuary policies are needlessly exposing New Yorkers to violence . 
1	68	 Mr. Cuomo is mimicking California Democrats , who are in open rebellion against federal law enforcement . 
1	68	 In February , Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf issued a public alert about a planned ICE raid in her city before it took place , tipping off hundreds of wanted criminals to scatter . 
1	68	" Attorney General Sessions said to Ms. Shaaf , "" How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of law enforcement just to promote your radical open borders agenda ? "" "
1	68	 Political pandering is driving this agenda . 
1	68	 An amazing 27 % of California 's population are immigrants . 
1	68	 Immigrants disproportionately favor big government . 
1	68	 California has n't elected a statewide Republican since 2006 . 
1	68	 New York is moving in the same direction , with 23 % of its population foreign - born and Democrats gaining increasing control of state government . 
1	68	" Mr. Cuomo and other Democrats have been resisting the federal crackdown on immigrant - related crime and calling for increased spending on after - school music and sports programs to provide an "" alternative "" to gang activity in immigrant communities . "
1	68	 That 's nonsense . 
1	68	 Brutes willing to torture and mutilate a human being with a machete will not be dissuaded by learning to play the flute . 
1	68	" President Trump calls them "" animals "" who have turned peaceful neighborhoods "" into bloodstained killing fields . "" "
1	68	" He 's got the right plan : "" We will find you . "
1	68	 We will arrest you . 
1	68	 We will jail you . 
1	68	" And we will deport you . "" "

1	71	Hillary Clinton was boring and exceptionally well - prepared . 
1	71	 Donald Trump was exciting but embarrassingly undisciplined . 
1	71	 He began with his strongest argument — that the political class represented by her has failed us and it 's time to look to a successful dealmaker for leadership — and kept to it pretty well for the first 20 minutes . 
1	71	 Then due to the vanity and laziness that led him to think he could wing the most important 95 minutes of his life , he lost the thread of his argument , he lost control of his temper and he lost the perspective necessary to correct these mistakes as he went . 
1	71	 Methodically and carefully , Hillary Clinton took over . 
1	71	 Her purpose was to show she was rational and policy - driven , the kind of person who could be trusted to handle a careful and delicate job with prudence and sobriety — and that he was none of these things . 
1	71	 And she succeeded . 
1	71	 By the end of the 95 minutes , Trump was reduced to a sputtering mess blathering about Rosie O'Donnell and about how he has n't yet said the mean things about Hillary that he is thinking . 
1	71	 Most important , he set ticking time bombs for himself over the next six weeks . 
1	71	" As she hammered him on his tax returns , he handed her an inestimable gift by basically saying he pays no federal taxes despite his billions — and moreover , that if he had done so , it would have been "" squandered "" anyway . "
1	71	 By the end of the 95 minutes , Trump was reduced to a sputtering mess blathering about Rosie O'Donnell and about how he has n't yet said the mean things about Hillary that he is thinking . 
1	71	 That 's not going to go away , nor is her suggestion that his refusal to release his returns is the result of his either not being as rich as he says or not being as charitable as he claims . 
1	71	" Clinton quoted him saying in 2006 that he hoped for a housing meltdown because it would provide buying opportunities and thereby goaded him into saying "" that 's called business , by the way . "" "
1	71	 To which she quickly replied that 9 million people lost their jobs and 5 million lost their homes in the housing meltdown he was so excited about . 
1	71	 Blammo . 
1	71	" His reply to Hillary 's recitation of the fact he 'd begun his career settling a Justice Department lawsuit about racial discrimination in Trump housing was that there was "" no admission of guilt , "" which is the sort of thing the villain said at the end of "" LA Law "" and sounded no better in real life . "
1	71	 Even when he could have taken her down , he was so incompetent he did n't go for it . 
1	71	 A question about cybersecurity was the perfect opportunity to hammer Clinton on her outrageous mishandling of classified information . 
1	71	 Instead , he went into a bizarre digression in which he alternately wondered whether his son Barron might grow up to become a hacker and defended Vladimir Putin from the accusation Russia had tapped into the Democratic National Committee 's emails ( which the FBI says almost certainly happened ) . 
1	71	 That has to count as the biggest choke of his political life . 
1	71	 By the time the last 15 minutes rolled around , he was reduced to yammering about Rosie O'Donnell being mean to him and Hillary running mean commercials about him and praising himself because there are some really terrible things he could have said about Hillary but has n't . 
1	71	" By this point , even his smart closing zinger — "" she has experience but it 's bad experience "" — was buried inside a weird word salad that reduced its effectiveness to almost nil . "
1	71	 His supporters should be furious with him , and so should the public in general . 
1	71	 By performing this incompetently , by refusing to prepare properly for this exchange , by not learning enough to put meat on the bones of his populist case against Clinton , he displayed nothing but contempt for the people who have brought him this far — and for the American people who are going to make this momentous decision on Nov. 8 .Trump 's debate incompetence a slap in the face to his supporters

1	73	Roy Moore and Donald Trump ( CNN / screen grab ) 
1	73	 The current political alliance between President Trump and Roy Moore is n't new - their collusion goes back at least to 2011 . 
1	73	" It was then that the two teamed up to promote the "" Birther Lie "" that President Obama was not born in the USA . "
1	73	 They served as active and vocal leaders of this racist cause over the five - year period from 2011 to 2016 . 
1	73	 President Obama 's short form and long form birth certificates were released by the Dept . 
1	73	 of Health of the State of Hawaii , in June 2008 and April 2011 respectively . 
1	73	 The birth records show that Barack Hussein Obama II was born at 7:24 pm on August 4 , 1961 , in the Kapiolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu , to Stanley Ann Dunham Obama and Barack Hussein Obama . 
1	73	" In the face of this documentary evidence , many early "" Birthers "" gave up the cause . "
1	73	 But not Trump and Moore . 
1	73	 They relentlessly promoted the lie , claiming in public speeches and interviews that they were privy to inside information that these birth certificates were forgeries . 
1	73	" Moore , who began his involvement in the cause in 2008 , declared to World Net Daily in 2010 that there was "" substantial evidence that Obama was not born in our country . "" "
1	73	" Trump , who did n't publicly join the cause until 2011 , tweeted on August 6 , 2012 that "" an ‘ extremely credible source ' has called my office and told me that Barack Obama 's birth certificate is a fraud . "" "
1	73	" Moore 's "" substantial evidence "" and Trump 's "" extremely credible source "" never , of course , materialized . "
1	73	 Moore combined his birther claims with the Islamophobic lie that Obama was secretly a Muslim , while Trump cleverly used the lie in his Presidential campaigns of 2012 and 2016 to solidify the nationalist , racist , anti - Obama core of his base . 
1	73	 The political effectiveness of the Birther Lie can be seen in the results of the NBC poll of September 2016 . 
1	73	" In the responses by registered Republicans only 28 % agreed with the statement that "" Barack Obama was born in the United States . "" "
1	73	 Another 41 % disagreed , and 31 % stated that they did n't know one way or the other . 
1	73	 The Birther Lie appears to have sowed doubt about the President being born in the U.S. , and thus the legitimacy of his Presidency , among nearly three - quarters of registered Republicans . 
1	73	" Trump officially gave up the "" Birther Lie "" on Sept. 16 , 2016 , with Moore doing so 3 months later . "
1	73	 When Trump gave up the lie , however , he replaced it with another one - naming his opponent Hillary Clinton as the originator of the whole birther idea , again of course without any evidence . 
1	73	 And now , in late 2017 , Trump has apparently decided to revive the lie , letting people around him know that he still believes it . 
1	73	" The "" Birther Lie "" shows us that Trump and Moore are inveterate liars . "
1	73	 So why should we believe them when they completely deny the credible testimonies of the more than 21 women who accuse one or the other of these men of sexual molesting them ? 
1	73	" Once again , these "" birther buddies "" would like us to ignore credible evidence and believe more of their big fat lies . "

1	74	Clinton now baselessly blames election - integrity laws for loss , media parrots 
1	74	 By Kathryn Blackhurst , LifeZette : 
1	74	" American Spectator Senior Editor John Fund blasted the media for refusing to cover former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton 's "" ravings "" claiming that "" voter suppression "" contributed to her Election Day loss , during an interview Wednesday on "" The Laura Ingraham Show . "" "
1	74	 Fund , a national - affairs columnist for National Review Online , said both Democrats and the mainstream media ridiculed President Donald Trump for claiming that 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally while giving Clinton a complete pass for her claims . 
1	74	 Pointing to the Public Interest Legal Foundation 's Monday report proving that more than 5,556 illegal voters were enrolled across 138 of Virginia 's counties and cities , Fund claimed that voter fraud is far more substantiated than Clinton 's claims . 
1	74	" "" All they do is yell ‘ voter suppression ! ' "
1	74	 But they do n't have any evidence . 
1	74	 They do n't have any statistics . 
1	74	 They do n't have any of them . 
1	74	" All they have are Hillary Clinton 's ravings . "" "
1	74	" "" There 's no evidence that voter ID laws prevent people from voting . "
1	74	" What really defeated Hillary Clinton was that in every single swing state , including states that do n't have voter ID , African - American turnout went down because African - American voters did n't particularly like Hillary Clinton , "" Fund said . "
1	74	" "" What we have is the Democrats actively trying to hide the ball on any attempt to find out if there is voter fraud , "" Fund continued . "" "
1	74	 All they do is yell ‘ voter suppression ! ' 
1	74	 But they do n't have any evidence . 
1	74	 They do n't have any statistics . 
1	74	 They do n't have any of them . 
1	74	" All they have are Hillary Clinton 's ravings . "" "
1	74	 No compatible source was found for this video . 
1	74	" Fund referred to Clinton 's recent interview with New York magazine in which she insisted , "" I would have won had I not been subjected to the unprecedented attacks by Comey and the Russians , aided and abetted by the suppression of the vote , particularly in Wisconsin . . . . "
1	74	 Whoever comes next , this is not going to end . 
1	74	" Republicans learned that if you suppress votes you win . "" "
1	74	" Declaring this unsubstantiated claim to be utter nonsense , Fund noted that even liberal organizations such as the fact - checking site Snopes , Vox , and Slate have all "" called Hillary 's assertion that she lost because of voter suppression just a fantasy . "" "
1	74	" "" But by the way , how much media coverage did you get ? "" "
1	74	 Fund said . 
1	74	 Instead , Trump 's claims of 3 million to 5 million people illegal voters have been getting all the attention . 
1	74	" "" Trump should have never have said it . "
1	74	" It discredits the cause , "" Fund conceded . "" "
1	74	 Having said that , the outrage against Trump was perfectly appropriate . 
1	74	 But where 's the outrage at Hillary Clinton coming up with her fantasy about voter suppression with just as little evidence ? 
1	74	" I do n't know if anyone in the media … has talked about it or heard about it . "" "
1	74	" Pointing once again to Virginia and its resident "" consigliere of the Clinton White House , "" Gov. Terry McAuliffe , Fund noted that he has "" desperately tried to prevent groups like the Public Interest Legal Foundation to go into voter registration rolls and try to find out who has been removed from the rolls in Virginia because "" they were illegally registered to vote when they obtained a driver 's license . "
1	74	" "" That would be the evidence that there were non - citizens voting in our elections , "" Fund said . "" "
1	74	 Well , McAuliffe sent out a directive to every local election official : Do n't cooperate with these questions . 
1	74	 And it turns out they now have the answers from 138 communities in Virginia . 
1	74	 Not the whole state , just part of it , [ that ] 5,500 non - citizens have been removed from the voter registration rolls in the last 5 years . 
1	74	" Over a third of them had been voting . "" "
1	74	 The real issue , Fund insisted , is former President Barack Obama 's reluctance to investigate or illegal voting or allow others to investigate whether the country 's democratic election process had been compromised . 
1	74	" "" For eight years , state after state asked the Obama administration 's Department of Homeland Security , ‘ You have a list of every legal alien in the country , people with green cards , student visas . "
1	74	 Please send us the list . 
1	74	" All we 'll do with it is match it with out voter - registration rolls and see if some non - citizens are registering and possibly voting , ' "" Fund said . "
1	74	" "" For eight years the Obama administration refused to turn over those lists , claiming ‘ privacy ' considerations , which were bogus , "" Fund added . "" "
1	74	" The reason why he claimed there is no voter fraud is he 's actively trying to hide it . "" "
1	74	 The Trump administration has since set up , by executive order , a commission to investigate voter fraud .

0	75	" But the event page listed a variety of items the group claimed it was worried about - including sexual allegations against the Seattle mayor and what the group called "" communist ideologies . "" "
0	75	 Leader Joey Gibson started the rally with the Pledge of Allegiance and a prayer asking for peace on the West Coast . 
0	75	 Speakers in the rally called the Charlottesville incident an act of terrorism , said that white supremacists were not welcome at their event , and asked anyone who attended for racist reasons to leave .

0	75	" In Charlottesville over the weekend , neo - Nazis , skinheads , Ku Klux Klan members and other white nationalists gathered to "" take America back "" and oppose plans to remove a Confederate statue in the Virginia college town , and hundreds of other people came to protest the rally . "
0	75	 The groups clashed in street brawls , with hundreds of people throwing punches , hurling water bottles and beating each other with sticks and shields . 
0	75	 Eventually , a car rammed into a peaceful crowd of anti - white - nationalist protesters , killing 32-year - old Heather Heyer . 
0	75	 A Virginia State Police helicopter deployed in a large - scale response to the violence then crashed into the woods outside of town .

0	77	Fox News panel with Katie Pavlich and Adrienne Elrod ( Photo : Screen capture ) 
0	77	 A Fox News host and panelist alleged that it was Hillary Clinton that colluded with Russia and thus should be taken to jail — not President Donald Trump . 
0	77	 While Russian bots sowed division among Democratic voters , attacked people of color , attacked Hillary Clinton , worked to suppress voters of color then spread fake voter fraud claims , Fox News thinks this was a campaign in favor of Clinton 's 2016 bid . 
0	77	" "" Well , if it 's really a big threat and we want to stop them from meddling in our elections , why is it that during a three - year time span the Obama administration really did n't do much to stop this from happening , "" asked Town Hall editor Katie Pavlich . "
0	77	 She referred to the 2012 election debate in which Mitt Romney cautioned that Russia was the greatest American foe over radical ISIS or Taliban extremists . 
0	77	 However , 2016 was the first election Russia is known to have infiltrated . 
0	77	" Pavlich and the host then turned to wonder why 300 elected officials did n't show up for the classified briefing held at the FBI involving the "" Gang of 8 . "" "
0	77	 The 300 members likely did n't have a high enough clearance level to view the classified documents . 
0	77	" The "" Gang of 8 "" all have the proper security clearance level to have viewed the documents . "
0	77	 The Fox host asked former Clinton staffer Adrienne Elrod if the entire Russia scandal could have been avoided if former President Barack Obama had stopped Russia before they even started . 
0	77	 Elrod explained that there was a lot of work going on behind the scenes . 
0	77	 Given the security level , it 's likely much of the information available at the time could not be made public . 
0	77	 She noted she wished Obama had acted prior to the election but asked what Trump is doing today to stop Russia from acting in the 2018 election . 
0	77	 The Fox host along with Pavlich went on to claim that Clinton was colluding with Russia because her campaign partially paid the law firm that bought the opposition research dossier from Christopher Steele . 
0	77	 Another portion of the dossier was paid for by Republicans hoping to discredit Trump prior to the general election . 
0	77	 For that reason , Fox News believes Clinton colluded with Russia more than Trump did . 
0	77	 Fox News hosts have also alleged that Clinton is behind the meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower .

1	78	"CNN 's Don Lemon discusses a potential "" whitelash "" created by President Trump with network contributor Van Jones and his panel . "
1	78	 From Friday 's broadcast of CNN Tonight : 
1	78	 DON LEMON , CNN : So we 're back now with my panel . 
1	78	 I want to bring them back in . 
1	78	 Scott Jennings , Van Jones and David Swerdlick . 
1	78	 Scott , I read those numbers differently than you read them . 
1	78	 Because it shows that -- I think that most people think that the players have the right to do it . 
1	78	 They have the right , that they 're doing the right thing or that they had the right to do it , not that they 're doing the right thing . 
1	78	 But I think that I read that differently , that poll differently than you did . 
1	78	 Van , I 'm not sure if that is what you wanted to comment on . 
1	78	 VAN JONES , CNN : Well , what I want to say is what 's surprising -- it 's not surprising that the majority of Americans look down on this protest . 
1	78	 If you look at the 1960s , 1963 , 67 , 70 percent of white Americans said , hey , stop this black protesting . 
1	78	 This freedom rights , you 're hurting your cause , the sit - in movement , you 're hurting your cause . 
1	78	 Cut it out , it 's bad . 
1	78	 Huge numbers of people in the ' 60s with Dr. King said stop these black protests . 
1	78	 When you look at these numbers , these are some of the most popular black protests in American history . 
1	78	 If you look at contextually , what they 're doing are some of the most popular protests in American history with white folks , because in general the white public has not liked to see black folks protesting . 
1	78	 So I see it differently . 
1	78	 LEMON : I see it differently because everyone , listen , when taking a knee , that is in reverence . 
1	78	 But even the player I had on Michael Thomas of the Miami Dolphins said to me the other night , he said , everybody would like to stand . 
1	78	 I think most people would like to stand . 
1	78	 What the issue is that -- in that poll , 60 percent of Americans think that President Trump did the wrong thing by criticizing the athletes . 
1	78	 This does n't necessarily that they agree with what they did , but they think he should not have inserted himself . 
1	78	 If you ask someone should you stand up for the flag ? 
1	78	 Of course they say you should stand up for the flag . 
1	78	 But did he do the right thing in calling them sons of bitches and saying they should be fired , the majority of people saying , no , he should n't have done that . 
1	78	 Van , I was talking to you , because I interrupted you . 
1	78	 JONES : I mean Donald Trump never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity . 
1	78	 Here 's an issue where his concern is this line with public opinion , but the way he deals with it is actually , you know , puts him in a super minority in terms of people who are able to somehow bring himself to support his language and demeanor . 
1	78	 I want to say this as clearly as I can say it . 
1	78	 In this country , African- Americans , no matter what we do -- when we sit in , when we freedom ride , when we kneel in , whatever it is , the initial response from the public tends to be overwhelmingly negative , because basically we 're kind of raining on folks ' parades , I do n't want to hear this stuff . 
1	78	 As time goes on , the Muhammad Ali 's and all the people that raised those issues , they then become heroes later . 
1	78	 They 're never heroes in the moment . 
1	78	 They 're heroes later on when people reflect on the courage they showed and the issues that they raised . 
1	78	 And that is really where we are . 
1	78	 Colin Kaepernick , as the years go on , will be a more and more revered figure and frankly , Donald Trump is in danger of being a more and more reviled figure as the years go on . 
1	78	 LEMON : Another message , David , from the President seems to be that he gets to define what patriotism is and who is patriotic . 
1	78	 SWERDLICK : That is right , Don . 
1	78	 And I think he is made the mistake here kind of along the lines of what Van is saying by casting his view in the way that he did . 
1	78	 There was a point just a week ago where the owners and management in the NFL were a lot closer to the position of the President by castigating the players in this way , he has driven the owners closer to the players because they -- I think been able to see that , ok , now when you have the players versus the President of the United States , you can see more clearly what the players are trying to do . 
1	78	" The players have said Colin Kaepernick has said , his former teammate Eric Reed said in "" The New York Times "" this week that they chose kneeling specifically , because they wanted to do a protest in the most respectful way possible . "
1	78	 They did n't stay in the locker room . 
1	78	 They did n't turn their backs on the flag . 
1	78	 They came out for the anthem , but knelt to underscore what is the underlying issue here , which is police violence and the tension between communities of color and police . 
1	78	 But , no , no , go ahead . 
1	78	 LEMON : Not to rush you guys along but I want to get to two things . 
1	78	 Why do we play the national anthem at a ball game anyway ? 
1	78	 Why is that such a big deal ? 
1	78	 JENNINGS : We play it at a lot of events . 
1	78	 I view it as one of the rituals that we all go through together that reminds us that we 're all in this together . 
1	78	 We 're all Americans and we 're all in this experience together . 
1	78	 But there 's an important set of rituals we go through that sort of give us that every now and then reminder that , hey , we 're all Americans and what does it mean to be an American ? 
1	78	 It means we 're all in this country together and we 're all fighting for the same thing , the same freedom , and the same liberty . 
1	78	 I think when people see what they perceive as disrespect of those rituals , they have a visceral reaction . 
1	78	 Trump has a visceral reaction , a lot of his supporters do . 
1	78	 According to a CNN poll 90 percent of his supporters had the same reaction that he did . 
1	78	 There 's a population that do n't like to see people disrespecting the rituals that reminds us , hey , we 're all in this together . 
1	78	 LEMON : That is been my whole point . 
1	78	 Is that this President has had the chance to elevate and educate people to realize that just by draping yourself in the flag is not necessarily patriotism . 
1	78	 That is just a ritual and rituals can be hollow . 
1	78	 Van , when you step back and think about all the President has said about the NFL players , and I know that -- is this a white lash against the players and the supporters that is what 's resulted here ? 
1	78	 JONES : If you take a big step back , there 's something happening throughout the west that this politics of resentment , this politics of kind of finding these dog whistle issues is becoming a playbook for a certain set of politicians . 
1	78	 You saw that happening in Germany , very far right people who made it to parliament in Germany . 
1	78	 Playing us against each other . 
1	78	 And I think the President of the United States is all too often guilty of those same kinds of tactics . 
1	78	 I think that we have forgotten -- we 've got of lost the plot here . 
1	78	 Those NFL players , the African - American ones , they say well , they 're rich . 
1	78	 They should just be grateful . 
1	78	 They should n't complain . 
1	78	 Rich celebrities should n't complain . 
1	78	 Donald Trump is a rich celebrity -- LEMON : All the time . 
1	78	 JONES : -- and he is been complaining all the time . 
1	78	 Apparently it 's ok to be a rich celebrity and complain . 
1	78	 Ask the President . 
1	78	 That is how he got where he is . 
1	78	 They say they should n't raise these issues , a lot of these guys are two or three years out of the hood . 
1	78	 Their families still live there . 
1	78	 They 're getting text messages from cousins . 
1	78	 They go home to thanksgiving to neighborhoods where if it was mine or yours or Donald Trump 's neighborhood , they would be screaming and yelling something is going terribly wrong . 
1	78	 The street violence and the police violence . 
1	78	 Too much violence , too many funerals .

0	79	Hillary Clinton has made it official . 
0	79	 The former secretary of state announced that she will be seeking the nomination for President of the United States on Sunday with a campaign video on her official website . 
0	79	" The spot opens with various people talking about their hopes for 2015 , ending with Clinton saying , "" I 'm getting ready to do something too . "
0	79	" I 'm running for President . "" "
0	79	" "" Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times , but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top , "" she continues . "" "
0	79	 Everyday Americans need a champion , and I want to be that champion . 
0	79	" So you can do more than just get by , you can get ahead and stay ahead . "" "
0	79	 Clinton 's run for the presidency will hardly come as a surprise . 
0	79	 The politician has long been hyped as the Democratic front - runner for the 2016 election . 
0	79	 This marks Clinton 's second time vying for the presidency . 
0	79	 She first ran during the 2008 election , but lost the Democratic ticket to then - junior senator Barack Obama . 
0	79	 Clinton later served on Obama 's cabinet , working as the secretary of state from the start of his presidency in 2009 through Feb. 1 , 2013 . 
0	79	 When Clinton , 67 , left her position in 2013 , political watchers took it as a sign that the former first lady was preparing for her own campaign in 2016 . 
0	79	 Her announcement makes her the first major candidate to seek out the Democratic nomination . 
0	79	 On the Republican side , Senator Ted Cruz , from Texas , and Senator Rand Paul , from Kentucky , have already thrown their hats into the ring . 
0	79	 Given Clinton 's high profile ( and the fact that her candidacy has been speculated about for years ) , she has become a major target for both other Democratic hopeful nominees and Republicans . 
0	79	 The past few months have n't been without scandal . 
0	79	" In March , she admitted to using a private email address while working as the secretary of state because it was "" convenient . "" "
0	79	" While the politician said that she was "" allowed "" to use her personal email , critics took issue with the fact that it caused an issue for journalists requesting records through the Freedom of Information Act and Benghazi investigators who have subpoenaed Clinton . "

1	80	"Ever since Kimmel became a DNC talking head , he 's become America 's "" moral conscience . "" — "
1	80	 But now the host is n't so sure ! 
1	80	 He claims he is n't — and therefore need not crack jokes about Harvey Weinstein . 
1	80	 That 's rich ! 
1	80	" "" First of all , the Harvey Weinstein thing , people like this false equivalence of that 's somehow equivalent to what happened in Las Vegas , "" Kimmel added , arguing that the alleged assault of dozens of women does not deserve the same reaction as the killing of nearly 60 people . "
1	80	" He said that Weinstein is "" not a friend of mine , "" adding , "" I 'm not in the movie business . "" "
1	80	 As a once and future Oscar host who is friends with many of the movie stars in Weinstein 's orbit , that claim is a hard one to buy . 
1	80	" On GMA , Kimmel went on to accuse "" gun nuts "" of "" trying take any comedy bit I did out of context and use it as some kind of proof "" that he is not an ally for women , including some pretty gross moments from The Man Show . "
1	80	" [ … ] "" They 're saying that I 'm calling myself the moral conscience of America , which I most certainly never did and most certainly never would , "" he declared . "
1	80	 Kimmel does n't seem at all bothered that conservatives want nothing to do with him and his show now . 
1	80	 Washington Examiner reports : 
1	80	" Critics like conservative commentator Ben Shapiro have slammed Kimmel for parading as a "" moral arbiter . "" "
1	80	" "" I 'm not . "
1	80	 I mean , I agree with him . 
1	80	" I 'm nobody 's moral arbiter , "" Kimmel told CBS . "" "
1	80	 You do n't have to watch the show . 
1	80	" You do n't have to listen to what I say . "" "
1	80	" A defiant Kimmel added that he does n't say "" I do n't mind "" because he preferred "" everyone with a television to watch the show . "" "
1	80	" "" But if they 're so turned off by my opinion on healthcare and gun violence then , I do n't know , I probably would n't want to have a conversation with them anyway , "" he continued . "" "
1	80	" Not good riddance , but riddance . "" "
1	80	 The last place you want to be is on the receiving end of Ben Shapiro 's laser sharp tongue . 
1	80	" The Daily Wire founder obliterated late night host Jimmy Kimmel 's "" abhorrent , "" and "" nasty "" gun control views . "
1	80	" Almost two weeks after demolishing Jimmy Kimmel over his asinine health - care tirades , conservative star and podcast host Ben Shapiro obliterating the ABC late - night host on Tuesday for an "" abhorrent , "" gross , "" and "" nasty "" gun control rant touting confiscation and mauling those against his views as monstrous . "
1	80	" "" Jimmy Kimmel should not cheered for what he did last night . "
1	80	 Jimmy Kimmel should be asked to provide the evidence for his suppositions rather than the evidence for his emotions . 
1	80	 Again , I believe he 's sincere . 
1	80	" Sincerity does not make what you 're saying smart , "" Shapiro argued at the end of his podcast , which featured over 20 minutes on Kimmel 's post - Las Vegas shooting rant . "
1	80	" Shapiro noted at the onset that "" Kimmel did something last night that I find truly abhorrent "" which was discard any and all facts as part of his effort to "" become the social justice king of late - night television "" and "" all - heart representation of all leftist causes . "" "
1	80	 Key highlights below : 
1	80	 Shapiro on leftists dividing America : 
1	80	" "" Last night , he did a long shitck about gun control that was entirely based on emotion and it was really nasty . "
1	80	 It was really nasty . 
1	80	 I do n't think it was nasty because he does n't care . 
1	80	 He cares . 
1	80	 It 's really nasty because he 's suggesting that you and I do n't care . 
1	80	 It does n't matter that you lost sleep last night and I lost sleep because of what happened . 
1	80	 It does n't matter that we 're all heartbroken over what happened . 
1	80	 We do n't agree with Jimmy Kimmel 's evidence - less suggestions about gun control . 
1	80	 That means that we do n't care . 
1	80	 We are bad people . 
1	80	 You want to know why the country is not unified ? 
1	80	 It 's because of stuff like this . 
1	80	 It 's not because we disagree on policy . 
1	80	 We 've been disagreeing about policy forever . 
1	80	" It 's because there are certain people in the American public discourse who feel it necessary to impute bad motives to people who disagree and that 's what Kimmel 's doing here . "" "
1	80	 Shapiro on Kimmel 's take about AR-15s : 
1	80	" "" So , number one , the Founders would have wanted us to have AR-15s because the fact is , back in the day , all the weapons that people had were military grade weapons , right ? "
1	80	 A musket was a military - grade weapon . 
1	80	 Now , AR-15s are n't military grade … Civilian guns are very different from military - issued guns . 
1	80	 For him to say the Second Amendment does n't cover things like AR-15s — a semi - automatic rifle , is akin to me saying the First Amendment does n't cover TV because the Founders had n't seen a TV , would never know what it 'd look like , and do n't understand how it works . 
1	80	 It 's a silly argument . 
1	80	 As far as the idea that ARs are n't used for home defense , again , asinine . 
1	80	" I have a bunch of friends who use ARs for home defense . "" "

1	82	Opinion 
1	82	 Modal Trigger

1	82	 Voters ' top concerns are the stagnant economy and the threat of terrorism , but you would n't know it from Hillary Clinton 's TV ads or campaign speeches . 
1	82	 She 's trying to twist the presidential race into a referendum on political correctness . 
1	82	 Too embarrassed to run on her party 's economic record or her failed stint as secretary of state , she 's positioning herself as top cop of the speech police . 
1	82	 For example , Hillary is running an ad depicting pre - teen girls looking self - consciously in the mirror , agonizing over their bodies . 
1	82	 Sometimes such young girls ' worries turn into deadly eating disorders , ultimately killing 10 percent of those affected . 
1	82	 Clinton cynically exploits the pain and fear felt by thousands of families . 
1	82	" Her ad uses a voiceover of Trump saying things like "" she ate like a pig "" and "" does she have a fat ass ? "" "
1	82	 Parents struggling with their child 's eating disorder run to one doctor after another frantically seeking answers . 
1	82	 The causes are complex and still not entirely known — but no one believes the cause is Donald Trump . 
1	82	 Some experts blame Hollywood 's glorification of skinny women for at least contributing to the rash of eating disorders and young girls ' body - image struggles . 
1	82	 Instead of trying to muzzle Trump and other men , why is n't Hillary calling out her big supporters in the entertainment industry ? 
1	82	 The same question applies to Hillary 's double standard in bashing Trump for lewdness but celebrating it in popular music . 
1	82	 Clinton 's latest super PAC ads condemn Trump 's bawdy 2005 remarks on a bus with show - biz journalist Billy Bush . 
1	82	" Trump bragged to his buddy , "" I moved on her like a bitch . "" "
1	82	" Clinton claims to have been outraged when she heard it , calling it "" horrific . "" "
1	82	" Manhattan Institute scholar Heather Mac Donald chuckles at Clinton 's hypocritical "" sudden onset of Victorian vapors . "" "
1	82	 After all , Clinton has no problem with the salacious lyrics of her pal and supporter Beyoncé . 
1	82	" Even when Beyoncé sings : "" I came to slay bitch . . . "
1	82	" when he f - k me good I take his ass to Red Lobster . "" "
1	82	" Clinton says , "" I want to be as good a president as Beyoncé is a performer . "" "
1	82	 Trump ca n't catch a break with Clinton , even when he 's trying to do the right thing . 
1	82	 Another Clinton ad attacks Trump reaching out to inner - city African - Americans with promises of more jobs and school choice . 
1	82	" Reminding minority voters that Democratic politicians have failed to improve their economic opportunities , Trump asks for their vote , saying : "" What the hell do you have to lose ? "" "
1	82	" Clinton 's ad says : "" Everything . "" "
1	82	 It follows her ad featuring Ku Klux Klan members praising Trump . 
1	82	 It 's McCarthyite guilt by association . 
1	82	 Trump has no connection to the group . 
1	82	 What 's Trump actually guilty of ? 
1	82	 Poaching on Hillary 's turf . 
1	82	 Worse than tarring Trump , she 's labeling cops , teachers and millions of other Americans racists . 
1	82	 Whenever she talks to black audiences , she stokes racial resentment . 
1	82	" She told the NAACP that whites "" need to recognize our privilege and practice humility . "" "
1	82	" All whites , she claims , have "" implicit bias , "" and she wants bias training for police and other professions . "
1	82	 Implicit bias — you 're told you have it even if you do n't realize it , no matter how colorblind you try to be , and denying your bias just proves it . 
1	82	 Implicit bias is PC drivel . 
1	82	 There 's no solid data to support it , cautions social scientists Philip Tetlock of UPenn and Gregory Mitchell of the University of Virginia and experts from New York University and the University of Connecticut . 
1	82	" But if Clinton becomes president , we 'll all be undergoing re - education at school or work to cure our "" implicit bias . "" "
1	82	 To see what President Hillary 's America would be like , look at most college campuses today . 
1	82	" Few on campus dare to question Black Lives Matter , militant multiculturalism and "" safe spaces "" to spare students from challenging ideas . "

0	84	 While President Donald Trump is attempting to fulfill his campaign promise to reduce illegal immigration , some young adults who were raised in America are fearing deportation . 
0	84	 Among those who could be deported is Jesus Contreras , a 23-year - old paramedic who worked six - straight days last week , rescuing fellow Houston - area residents from the flooding left behind from Hurricane Harvey . 
0	84	 Contreras told NBC News last week that his family came to the United States when he was age 6 . 
0	84	" His family wanted to escape what he described as a "" violent situation "" in his hometown of Nuevo Laredo . "
0	84	 After six exhausting days of saving lives , Contreras learned on Friday that Trump was considering ending DACA . 
0	84	 DACA protects a group of 800,000 American residents from deportation . 
0	84	 Those 800,000 young undocumented immigrants were those who entered the United States as a child and have been in the United States since 2007 . 
0	84	 Those who qualify under DACA are given two - year work permits , which allows them to stay in the United States with some legal status . 
0	84	" "" We just got hit by a hurricane here — and now we 're getting hit by another storm , an even bigger one , "" Contreras told NBC News on Friday . "
0	84	 The threat of getting deported made it more challenging for first responders during Harvey , Contreras told the Houston Chronicle . 
0	84	" "" People were scared that boats from U.S. immigration services were out there , "" Contreras told the Chronicle . "" "
0	84	" People were n't sure if they were trying to round up people from the water and take them straight to the immigration center . "" "
0	84	 On Tuesday , Trump is expected to announce that DACA will come to an end in six months . 
0	84	 The six months give a deeply divided Republican - held Congress an opportunity to do something it has struggled to do : Immigration reform . 
0	84	 While Trump was on the campaign trail , he promised to end DACA . 
0	84	" But since being elected , Trump said that those under DACA "" should n't worry . "" "
0	84	 In the meantime , people like Contreras continue to go to work not knowing how many days they have left in America .

1	86	 Less than 1 percent of refugees get approved for relocation .

1	86	 There , interviews with USCIS officers would take place and fingerprints run through biometric databases of the FBI , Homeland Security and Department of Defense . 
1	86	 If all these are passed , health screenings take place . 
1	86	 Then refugees are enrolled in cultural orientation classes while information continues to be checked . 
1	86	 This process typically takes 18 to 24 months after applying to the UN .

1	86	 PalmettoTrump : The pathological liar
1	87	In recent months , late - night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel has taken to scaremongering his audience with well - worn Democratic Party talking points regarding health care insurance policy . 
1	87	 Between yuks , he occasionally accuses Republicans of being would - be baby killers , which is treated as an important political development because , well , Jimmy Kimmel is famous . 
1	87	" This week , the comedian was back to explain why the new Graham - Cassidy Republican "" repeal "" bill is bad news . "
1	87	 There were only two things wrong with his monologue : Almost everything he said was either completely untrue or highly misleading , and his simplistic emotional appeal was completely disconnected from the real world . 
1	87	 The comedian 's interest in policy was sparked by the harrowing experience of having a newborn son who suffered from a rare health condition . 
1	87	" Thankfully , his boy is OK . "" "
1	87	" If your baby is going to die and it does n't have to , it should n't matter how much money you make , "" said an emotional Kimmel in May. "" I think that 's something that , whether you 're a Republican or a Democrat or something else , we all agree on that , right ? "" "
1	87	 Yes , everyone agrees . 
1	87	 As far as I know , there is n't a single politician in America who has ever supported allowing babies to die because they are born with birth defects , even if the parents ca n't pay . 
1	87	 Not pre - Obamacare , and not post - Obamacare . 
1	87	 In any event , after Kimmel 's May rant , Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy showed up on his show to explain his position . 
1	87	 These types of culture encounters should n't be dismissed , because the fact is most viewers are unaware of specific policies and have a notional understanding that 's prejudiced by the establishment media 's coverage . 
1	87	" Cassidy came up with something he called the "" Jimmy Kimmel Test , "" a test that no "" family should be denied medical care , emergency or otherwise , because they ca n't afford it . "" "
1	87	" Kimmel claims that the new bill does n't meet this threshold . "" "
1	87	" This guy , Bill Cassidy , just lied right to my face , "" the talk - show host said on Tuesday night during an extended political rant . "
1	87	" He went on to say , "" And by the way , before you post a nasty Facebook message saying I 'm politicizing my son 's health problems , I want you to know : I am politicizing my son 's health problems . "" "
1	87	 OK . 
1	87	" He explained : "" Coverage for all ? "
1	87	 No . 
1	87	" Fact , it will kick about 30 million Americans off insurance . "" "
1	87	" Not a single person would be "" kicked off "" his or her insurance . "
1	87	 Rather , the Congressional Budget Office review of the AHCA found that of the 24 million Americans who would no longer have health insurance after an Obamacare repeal , 14 million would choose not to buy insurance in 2018 in the absence of a penalty . 
1	87	 And if Obamacare were not repealed , the CBO projects another 6 million people would voluntarily leave the Obamacare markets . 
1	87	 Now , if you do n't believe Americans should be afforded the choice to leave or not buy insurance , just say that . 
1	87	 No one is being kicked off . 
1	87	 Moreover , if Kimmel supports the individual mandate , Graham - Cassidy allows California to institute it -- as I am sure it would . 
1	87	" Kimmel says : "" Pre - existing conditions ? "
1	87	 Nope . 
1	87	" If the bill passes , individual states can let insurance companies charge more if you have a pre - existing condition . "" "
1	87	" States would be allowed to apply for waivers to change what qualifies as an essential health benefit as long as they still preserve "" adequate and affordable health insurance coverage "" for people with pre - existing conditions . "
1	87	" You may prefer price fixing to allowing states flexibility to try and fix these problems , but Graham - Cassidy does not break the "" Jimmy Kimmel Test . "" "
1	87	 Kimmel might not be aware that there is no plan in place that has government cutting checks after every surgery . 
1	87	 Kimmel then implored his audience to call Cassidy to stop the imaginary bill he had just described . 
1	87	 It 's a shame that Kimmel did n't provide a number to call for the tens of millions of Americans who have seen their premiums and out - of - pocket costs skyrocket under Obamacare 's strictures . 
1	87	" Is there no number available for those who are sick of being in exchanges that coerce them to buy plans they do n't need that are sold by companies they do n't like in fabricated , noncompetitive "" markets "" with dwindling choices ? "
1	87	 Anyway , so went a monologue that could have been written by any liberal activist . 
1	87	 Which is to say it was all about cheap zero - sum emotionalism . 
1	87	 Kimmel does n't believe Americans deserve the chance to reduce the cost of health care with market - based reforms on the state level , or in giving states any flexibility in catering their plans to their own citizens . 
1	87	 Kimmel believes California and New York should spend more per capita and smaller states should suffer . 
1	87	 Kimmel does n't believe that individuals and families should be allowed to contribute to health savings accounts or use them to help pay ever - growing insurance premiums . 
1	87	 Kimmel wants average Americans to suffer . 
1	87	 You see ? 
1	87	 Anyone can play this game .

1	88	 The Man Who Predicted The Top Stock On The S&P 500 Makes NEW Shocking Prediction 
1	88	 US President Trump 's threats this week to shut down critical news media is an ominous sign of how fragile American democratic rights have become . 
1	88	" For Donald Trump to impugn media freedom -- albeit in his usual whimsical , boorish fashion -- nevertheless shows how far democracy has been eroded in the "" land of the free . "" "
1	88	 The latest furore followed a report this week by NBC in which Trump purportedly harangued his top Pentagon advisers for a 10-fold increase in the US nuclear weapons arsenal . 
1	88	 Trump 's outlandish demand was reportedly made during a high - level national security meeting back in July . 
1	88	" It was the same meeting during which Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is said to have scoffed at Trump 's antics and called him a "" moron . "" "
1	88	" Trump has reacted angrily to the reports , dismissing them with his characteristic jargon as "" fake news . "" "
1	88	" But , adding to the furore , the president also went on to question whether the broadcasting license of NBC and other networks should be cancelled because of what Trump views as "" fake news . "" "
1	88	 That is , the president is speculating on shutting down media outlets . 
1	88	 Such a move by a president would be legally unviable , according to US laws . 
1	88	 But it shows the kind of slippery slope that US media and democratic rights are on . 
1	88	 Trump 's latest musing about shutting down NBC and other channels drew predictable outcry from US media , who rightly to a degree , deplored his attack on democratic rights . 
1	88	 The irony is , however , that the attack on American democratic rights has already been underway before Trump entered the White House , and without much protest from the same media outlets who are now railing against Trump over this rant . 
1	88	 We can point to the increasing surveillance powers of federal intelligence agencies which have steadily encroached since the September 2001 terror incidents in New York and Washington DC . 
1	88	 Media freedom in the US has been under assault for a long time . 
1	88	 Trump 's latest outburst is not a one - off anomaly . 
1	88	 In recent weeks , the US government has moved to severely restrict the freedom of Russia - based news media operating in the country . 
1	88	 A move that has so far not been reciprocated by Moscow on US media operating in Russia . 
1	88	" Russian state - owned news channel RT has been forced to register as a "" foreign agent "" which will curtail how it carries out normal journalistic functions . "
1	88	" Sputnik , another Russian state - owned channel , is also under investigation by US authorities over allegations of destabilizing American politics with "" fake news . "" "
1	88	" The crimping of Russian news media is part of a wider campaign to suppress all alternative media outlets , including US - based websites , which are being labelled as agents of "" foreign interests "" because of merely posting articles sourced from RT and Sputnik . "
1	88	" The willing participation of US internet companies , Google , Twitter and Facebook , in blocking news sources that are designated "" fake "" or "" interfering in US politics "" is another troubling sign of how citizens ' access to information is being curtailed . "
1	88	" These gatekeepers of information are openly moving to restrict access to "" authoritative , "" "" respectable "" media outlets . "
1	88	" Many of these "" respectable "" news outlets , such as the New York Times and Washington Post , have in the past been guilty of purveying outrageously fake news , like the "" weapons of mass destruction "" claims which led to the 2003 US war in Iraq that killed over a million people and unleashed on the world the ongoing scourge of jihadist terrorism . "
1	88	" The Mysterious "" Secret Stock "" - It Could Fund Your Retirement "
1	88	" There is absolutely no credible evidence that Russian news media or alternative US - based sites are systematically engaged in an "" influence campaign "" to destabilize American democracy . "
1	88	 Sure , there is plenty of false information on the internet available through platforms like Facebook , which most Americans now rely on for their news feed . 
1	88	 But to lay the blame for this on Russian media is preposterous scapegoating . 
1	88	 What really is the issue here is that US authorities and established media companies simply ca n't abide rival outlets that are providing an alternative , critical perspective . 
1	88	 For example , Russia 's RT and Sputnik have given much critical coverage on the war in Syria , as well as conflicts in Ukraine , Yemen and elsewhere . 
1	88	 Both channels have reported , with documentary evidence , on how the US government and its NATO and regional allies have been complicit in an illegal , covert war for regime change in Syria involving support for extremist militant groups . 
1	88	 This is a critical perspective with grave legal and political implications for Washington and its allies . 
1	88	" Just because the US government does not like this kind of unflattering coverage does not legitimize its opprobrium of "" fake news . "" "
1	88	 The latter charge is brazenly being used as a pretext to censor discomfiting information . 
1	88	 There are many other international issues where Russian media are giving a valid , alternative viewpoint . 
1	88	" And because official US interests are offended by this critical perspective , the authorities are moving to ostracize Russian media with the spurious allegation of "" foreign agents "" and "" undermining American democracy . "" "
1	88	 But the paramount issue here is that this is an audacious attack on American democratic rights of free media and freedom of speech , as supposedly enshrined in the US Constitution 's First Amendment . 
1	88	" All of the US established news media have propagated the bogus narrative of "" Russian influence "" and "" Russian fake news . "" "
1	88	 This narrative plays well for political opponents of President Trump , primarily in the Democrat party . 
1	88	" On this issue , Trump is right when he denounces as "" fake news "" the campaign to pillory Russia and to allege that the Kremlin directed state - owned media to influence the November presidential election in Trump 's favor . "
1	88	 There is simply no evidence that Russian news media were or are engaged in anything nefarious to destabilize US democracy . 
1	88	 Russian media have and do give critical news coverage . 
1	88	" If that "" destabilizes "" Washington 's illicit activities in overseas ' wars then that 's what responsible journalism should be doing . "
1	88	 To curb this journalism because it offends geopolitical interests is , frankly , censorship and the actions of a tyrant . 
1	88	" Trump 's latest threats to shut down the American news channel NBC over alleged "" fake news "" are indeed menacing . "
1	88	 The NBC report on Trump 's nuclear weapons ranting appear to be credible in any case . 
1	88	 But the outcry from US media over Trump 's boorish threats are hypocritical . 
1	88	 Their concern seems to be based on a superficial contempt for Trump as a loathsome individual -- as opposed to a principled defense of democratic rights , and media freedom in particular . 
1	88	" The US media outlets that are piously railing against Trump over his "" assault on the Fourth Estate "" are the same outlets which have piled on the pressure to suppress alternative media outlets like Russia 's RT and Sputnik , as well as other US - based independent information sources that are being demonized in McCarthyite fashion as "" foreign agents . "" "
1	88	 And , again , much of this hostility towards alternative media is motivated by the fact that these alternative media have admirably exposed the hypocrisy and criminality of US authorities . 
1	88	 Also exposed is the aiding and abetting by the servile establishment media who have long covered up for the US authorities and their illicit activities in overseas ' wars and against citizens at home . 
1	88	 American democratic rights are indeed on thin ice . 
1	88	 But that was the case long before the elephantine Trump arrived on the scene . 
1	88	 His clumsy lurching is merely serving to illustrate how treacherously thin the ice has become upon which US democracy now stands .

0	89	 However , there 's already a plan for what happens next . 
0	89	 On January 20 , 2017 , when either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton takes office , they 'll gain access to the @POTUS account and its 11 million followers , according to Twitter . 
0	89	 The National Archives and Records Administration will also archive other Twitter handles , including @WhiteHouse , @VP , and @PressSec , according to Twitter . 
0	89	 One big question mark is what will happen to the @FLOTUS Twitter account . 
0	89	 While it 's also included in the transition , it 's possible Twitter may need to change that to @FMOTUS come January 20 if we elect our first female president .What Happens to the @POTUS Twitter After Obama Leaves ?
0	90	Medical science is constantly making cancer breakthroughs , however there 's an extensive process to bring treatments to the public . 
0	90	 After making a discovery in the lab and performing tests , there are human clinical trials that require oversight by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) before approval . 
0	90	 That being said , there are some promising new treatments ( with some currently still in the investigational stages ) targeting cancer , and they could prove valuable to millions of patients in the U.S. and beyond in the future . 
0	90	 Here are six experimental cancer treatments that are catching attention from the medical world … 
0	90	 1 . 
0	90	 Hyperthermia Therapy 
0	90	 BestMedicalDegrees.com outlines this experimental use of heat to target tumors . 
0	90	 This technique can zero in on specific areas or heat the whole body , which will break down protein cells within a tumor and cause them to die , notes the source . 
0	90	" While the treatment can potentially blast away existing cells , it could also help prevent new ones from forming . "" "
0	90	" Hyperthermia Therapy is very exciting because , if it turns out to be a viable treatment , this will destroy the cancerous tumors from the inside out and hinder its ability to infect more healthy cells , "" adds the source . "
0	90	 2 . 
0	90	 Cellular Adoptive Immunotherapy 
0	90	 Also called adoptive cell transfer , the experimental technique aims to improve the ability of a patient 's natural T - cells ( lymphocytes for immunity ) to fight cancer , according to the National Cancer Institute . 
0	90	 Doctors can take the best and most active T - cells that have invaded a tumor and extract them to multiply in a lab - the patient 's immune cells are then wiped out and the lab - grown cells are re - infused back to them , it adds . 
0	90	 There are variations of this treatment , and the first use of it targeted metastatic melanoma , which can spread quickly through the body . 
0	90	 Modified T - cells are also being looked at to treat other solid tumors as well as hematologic cancers ( cancers of the blood ) , it adds . 
0	90	 3 . 
0	90	 Molecularly Targeted Therapy 
0	90	" ABC News says in an article that this therapy consists of drugs that are aimed at destroying only specific cancer cells , without negatively affecting healthy cells as many existing treatments do . "" "
0	90	" Thus , people taking the drugs too often suffer horrible side effects on top of whatever havoc the cancer itself is already wreaking , "" notes the source . "
0	90	 ABC says the leading drug in this new therapy is called Glivec ( or STI571 ) . 
0	90	" It is designed to treat a specific form a leukemia called chronic myeloid leukemia , which has about 7,000 new cases per year in the U.S. , adds the source . "" "
0	90	" Doctors are extremely hopeful that the drug could provide a model for similar drugs to treat cancers affecting many thousands more people , "" it notes . "
0	90	 4 . 
0	90	 TNFR2-targeting Antibodies 
0	90	 The National Cancer Institute detailed a potential new cancer therapy in early 2017 , which looks to target ovarian cancer cells . 
0	90	" The basics are that tumor cells "" express "" a protein called TNFR2 , which can prevent a patient 's natural immune system from attacking a tumor . "
0	90	" Researchers have developed new antibodies that target TNFR2 , as well as having the ability to kill ovarian cancer cells , thus "" killing two birds with one stone , "" notes the source . "
0	90	 The team found that ovarian cancer cells express an abnormal level of TNFR2 that can promote tumor growth - and the source points out other types of cancers , such as colon and kidney cancer , also show unusual TNFR2 production . 
0	90	 5 . 
0	90	 Tumor Treating Fields 
0	90	 This therapy , which the American Brain Tumor Association said was recently approved by the FDA for glioblastoma ( an aggressive brain cancer ) , usually follows surgery and radiation therapy , adds the source . 
0	90	 It involves ceramic discs called transducer arrays to deliver electromagnetic energy to the scalp . 
0	90	" "" These electrical fields exert selective toxicity in proliferating cells thereby halting cell division and destroying the cancer cells , "" notes the source . "
0	90	 While the treatment is used in conjunction with oral chemotherapy drugs for glioblastoma ( GBM ) , it can be used on its own to target recurrent ( returning ) GBM when other options have been exhausted , according to the source . 
0	90	 6 . 
0	90	 Virus Therapy 
0	90	 Usually , having a virus is a bad thing . 
0	90	 However , this therapy essentially involves introducing a virus to cancer cells that leave healthy cells alone , notes StandUp2Cancer.org . 
0	90	 The virus only seeks out cancer cells due to their genetic mutation that normal cells do n't have , it explains . 
0	90	 One treatment in particular is called Reolysin , developed by a Canadian biotechnology company , notes the source . 
0	90	" The site notes that almost 300-patients "" with various forms of cancer "" in Canada , the U.S. and the U.K. have been treated with this therapy , which infects cancer cells and causes them to explode . "
0	90	 Apparently , side effects ( such as a low - grade fever ) are a lot milder than those associated with chemotherapy and radiation , it adds .6 Promising New Medical Treatments for Cancer

0	92	Another day , another uncomfortably shady revelation about Donald Trump 's presidential campaign and possible connections to Russia . 
0	92	 This time , it 's the news that FBI investigators wiretapped Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort not once , but two times before and after the presidential election , per a CNN report . 
0	92	 The news source reported on Sept. 18 that the surveillance continued into the early part of 2017 , when Manafort had long since left the Trump team but was still in communications with the President . 
0	92	" Several sources told CNN that the intelligence which the investigation collected included communications that "" sparked concerns … that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign , "" though at least two sources specifically added that the evidence was n't conclusive . "
0	92	 Manafort was surveilled under a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) warrant , which must be backed with information showing suspicion that the subject could be acting as an agent of a foreign power . 
0	92	 The warrant must be approved by top officials in the FBI and the Department of Justice . 
0	92	 Notably , there 's a big piece of the puzzle missing . 
0	92	 CNN reports that the FBI was not surveilling Manafort during the now - infamous meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer with Kremlin connections in June 2016 , which then - campaign manager Manafort and Trump 's son - in - law and current White House adviser Jared Kushner also attended . 
0	92	 But even with the missing pieces , the fact that government investigators were able to get the warrant , with such a high bar for approval , means that things are getting real for the investigation into Trump campaign leaders ' dealings with Russia . 
0	92	 Manafort was originally investigated for his alleged shady dealings with former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych , who was at the head of a pro - Russian party which was driven out in 2014 by civil unrest and street protests . 
0	92	 Manafort 's firm was accused of lobbying for Yanukovych 's interests while failing to register with the U.S. government as a lobbyist for a foreign power . 
0	92	 In fact , that accusation is why Manafort left the Trump campaign back in August of 2016 , after reports of the connections surfaced . 
0	92	 But if the first warrant was based on his dealings with sketchy oligarchs , the second one is reportedly the more damning . 
0	92	 CNN 's sources said that the second warrant , the start date of which is unknown , was based on efforts to investigate possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian agents . 
0	92	 So basically , for the first warrant there needed to be suspicion that Manafort was dealing with the Ukrainians ( which , yeah , he was ) . 
0	92	 For the second , investigators needed suspicion he was talking to Russian operatives — which is way more specific , and given Manafort 's role in the Trump campaign , could be incredibly damning . 
0	92	" On the other hand , the report also gives some near - credibility to Trump 's old claim that former President Barack Obama was wiretapping him ( and by "" credibility , "" I mean you have to tilt your head and squint to "" see "" it ) . "
0	92	" Back in March , Trump tweeted an accusation that Obama had wiretapped him at his residence at his eponymous Trump Tower shortly before the 2016 election , calling the former president "" sick . "" "
0	92	 Representatives of both Obama and the Department of Justice said that the claims were baseless . 
0	92	 While Manafort keeps a residence at Trump Tower , there is still no evidence Trump himself was under surveillance . 
0	92	 Which , however , does n't mean he was n't picked up by the surveillance on Manafort . 
0	92	 CNN notes that Trump and Manafort continued to communicate for months after Manafort left the campaign , even after the FBI investigation into the former campaign manager became public knowledge . 
0	92	" The conversations reportedly continued until lawyers for both men "" insisted they stop . "" "
0	92	 But this is n't even the worst news for Manafort that came out today . 
0	92	 Special counsel Robert Mueller , who is leading the investigation into Russian interference in the election , reportedly told Manafort in July that the investigation planned to indict him , according to The New York Times . 
0	92	 Agents reportedly showed up at Manafort 's house with a search warrant , combing through his Virginia home and taking away binders of documents , computer files , and even photos of his wardrobe . 
0	92	 A physical search warrant is unusual for someone whose lawyer has already been in touch with the Justice Department , as Manafort 's has been — and is an indicator that prosecutors had probable cause to believe that the home contained evidence of a crime , and were concerned about destruction of evidence . 
0	92	" As former federal prosecutor Jimmy Gurulé told the Times , "" clearly they did n't trust him . "" "
0	92	 So , it 's not looking good for old Paul , here .

1	95	 From Washington , D.C. to the NFL and Hollywood , America 's idols are tumbling down . 
1	95	 This is not a bad thing . 
1	95	" For too long , we have wasted precious time and money worshipping these so - called "" social justice "" warrior hypocrites who continue to disappoint . "
1	95	 Here 's to hoping all this disappointment will lead us back to what really matters , but do n't count on it . 
1	95	 Huge swaths of Americans still bow at the altar of social justice . 
1	95	" They believe government - forced "" charity "" will advance us to an utopian paradise where everyone enjoys the same outcome , despite personal effort , upbringing , unique abilities and education . "
1	95	 Truth is , though , social justice is an oxymoron based on the false premise that the cure for injustice is leveling the playing field and redistributing wealth . 
1	95	" As former Vice President Joe Biden once said , "" You may call it redistribution of wealth â€ ' I just call it being fair . "" "
1	95	 Karl Marx would be so proud . 
1	95	 Marx hated religion , private property and Judeo - Christian values as much as leftists do today . 
1	95	 That 's why you should bolt out of any place of worship that combines Jesus , social justice and the government in the same sentence . 
1	95	" In his book , "" The Fatal Conceit : The Errors of Socialism , "" economist Friedrich Hayek nails what 's really at stake : "" The aim of socialism is no less than to affect a complete redesigning of our traditional morals , law and language â€ ' and on this basis to stamp out the old order and the supposedly inexorable , unjustifiable conditions that prevent the institution of reason , fulfillment , true freedom and justice . "" "
1	95	 Yesteryears ' creepy social justice warriors are now out of the closet and no longer hide their agenda . 
1	95	 Instead , they give it a pink boa and parade their intentions to destroy capitalism , silence free speech and scrub Judeo - Christian values from the public square . 
1	95	 They harp about injustice and claim only they can fix it , which is one of the most arrogant , egotistical piles of hogwash you 'll ever hear . 
1	95	 All that , while they divide us into two groups , normal folks and them . 
1	95	 They believe normal folks are about as smart as slugs , therefore incapable of coherent reasoning and self - care . 
1	95	 To them , everyday Americans are n't diamonds in the rough , they are pliable , moldable objects used to reshape America into a socialist nightmare like Venezuela . 
1	95	 As I 've said before , Democrats ' sacrosanct belief that the government was created to control how fairness is spread around is nothing more than a modern - day effort to reinvent Robin Hood , without all the chivalry and green tights . 
1	95	 Those who romantically embrace the concept of social justice believe the misnomer that stealing from some and passing it on to those who should have had it in the first place will result in some sort of righteous leveling . 
1	95	 Leftists do n't own the market on charity . 
1	95	 Normal folks leave government out of the mix and combine their compassion with common sense . 
1	95	 They bring food in one hand and a rifle in the other , knowing if they teach someone how to hunt , they 'll eat for a lifetime . 
1	95	 In comparison , leftists bring Trader Joe 's bagels in one hand and a voter 's registration card in the other . 
1	95	 Seizing the opportunity to convert their victims into non - thinking entitlement aficionados , they stop at nothing to meet an immediate need , then lead them by their noses to leftist - run metropolises where crime and government handouts abound . 
1	95	 I know , the devil is always in the details , but I 'll go ahead and say it anyhow . 
1	95	" Forced "" charity "" does n't bring about justice . "
1	95	 Instead , it creates injustice when it stirs up animosity between the less fortunate and those being penalized , taxed , for their hard work under penalty of prosecution . 
1	95	 In sharp contrast , there is a power in authentic generosity that no amount of government social - engineering could or will ever match . 
1	95	 The social justice crowd should dust off the knees they protest with and try it sometime .

1	96	Guest post by Joe Hoft 
1	96	 Former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller have done much to discredit the name and reputation of the FBI . 
1	96	 Now the FBI wo n't release information in regards to their investigation of 59 people killed in Las Vegas . 
1	96	 This further tarnishes this respected organization 's good name . 
1	96	 James Comey hurt the FBI 's name immensely by the actions he took surrounding Hillary Clinton in last year 's campaign . 
1	96	 Liberals believe Comey gave the election to President Trump because her name was tarnished from Comey 's actions but they totally disregard her criminal actions that led her to be in that place . 
1	96	 Conservatives felt like Comey gave Hillary a pass for her obvious criminal actions . 
1	96	 On June 27th Bill Clinton met with US Attorney General Loretta Lynch in her plane in Arizona for a half an hour . 
1	96	 Within a week Lynch 's Department of Justice dropped the investigation into Hillary 's emails and FBI 's Comey made the announcement . 
1	96	 Comey 's statements were later compared to Hillary 's prior statements - 
1	96	 After FBI Director Comey announced that the FBI would not recommend criminal charges be filed against Hillary , he was grilled in Congress by US Representative Trey Gowdy - 
1	96	 Comey then announced in late October , shortly before the election that the FBI was reopening its investigation into Hillary 's emails . 
1	96	 Apparently emails recovered in the pervert Anthony Wiener case ended up being related to the Hillary investigation . 
1	96	 Wiener was the husband of Clinton confidant Huma Abedin and reportedly Clinton emails were found on Huma 's computer after Huma stated under oath that all her emails were turned over . 
1	96	 A week or so later , again Comey let Hillary off again . 
1	96	 This was in spite of the fact that an email released from WikiLeaks showed that Hillary 's longtime assistant Cheryl Mills ordered Hillary 's email server to be bleached clean . 
1	96	 There was and is more than enough information in the public arena to have Hillary brought to court for her actions . 
1	96	 After President Trump was elected President he fired Comey as Head of the FBI . 
1	96	 After this Comey appeared at a Congressional Hearing and after berating President Trump stated under oath that he had leaked classified information to the press ( a clear crime ) . 
1	96	 Former Director Mueller was even worse . 
1	96	 He was Comey 's mentor . 
1	96	 There are many major scandals and likely crimes that Mueller did not meaningfully investigate when he was FBI Director resulting in no arrests and no consequences related to Obama and the Clintons : 
1	96	 Emailgate ( 2007 ) : discovery that several top Bush administration officials violated the Presidential Records Act by using an RNC server for email communications while conducting official business , followed by the deletion of millions of the same emails 
1	96	 IRS Targeting ( 2010 - 2013 ) : the IRS intentionally selected and then delayed or denied tax - exempt 501(c)(3 ) applications from conservative groups to prevent them from participating in the 2012 election , followed by IRS agent Lois Lerner invoking her Fifth Amendment privilege against self - incrimination 
1	96	" Fast and Furious ( 2010 ) : this ATF program , which seems to have served no rational purpose , allowed over 2,000 guns to be purchased illegally inside the United States and then "" walked "" into Mexico for use by criminals , one of which was later used in the 2010 murder of Border Agent Brian Terry by the member of a Mexican cartel "
1	96	 Associated Press Spying ( 2012 ) : the Department of Justice illegally seized the communications of AP reporters made during April and May 2012 , allowing the DOJ to unmask journalists ' confidential sources 
1	96	" Clinton Foundation Pay - for - Play ( 2009 - 2013 ) : during the period in which Hillary Clinton held the office of Secretary of State , the Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton received millions of dollars in paid speaking fees and a million dollar "" gift""from countries involved in matters with the State Department , many of which had ties to terrorism and human rights abuses ; some of these funds were apparently diverted from charitable causes to personal expenses , such as Chelsea Clinton 's 2010 wedding "
1	96	 Russian Uranium Deal ( 2009 - 2013 ) : Hillary Clinton 's State Department approved a deal allowing a Russian company to control 20 % of the uranium mining production capacity inside the United States , which was followed by millions of dollars in donations to the Clinton Foundation from people associated with the transaction 
1	96	" Clinton Private Email Server ( 2009 - 2013 ) : during her entire tenure as Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton dodged Freedom of Information Act requirements by using a private email server to conduct official government business , as well as sent and received classified information that was Top Secret over an unsecured system — an "" extremely reckless "" ( and obviously illegal ) act . "" "
1	96	 Mueller , by not upholding the law in these cases above , created a two - tiered system of law in the US - Laws for the political liberal elite and laws for everyone else . 
1	96	 Mueller is a bad cop for other reasons . 
1	96	 Although he has many conflicts of interest he went ahead and accepted the position to investigate the fake Trump colluded with Russia story . 
1	96	 Even liberal publications like the USA Todayreported in June that Mueller should step down as special prosecutor because of his conflicts of interest with the investigation he is carrying on . 
1	96	 Another reason and more justification for Mueller being a bad cop is related to the personnel he has hired to assist in the Russia investigation . 
1	96	 Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's fifteen attorneys are a Who 's Who of Liberal Activism . 
1	96	 He is not performing an investigation , he is on a liberal witch hunt . 
1	96	 This leads us to today . 
1	96	 Last night a press conference was held jointly by the FBI and the local Sheriff in Las Vegas concerning the recent killing of at least 59 people in that city a few days ago . 
1	96	 The Sheriff was very transparent in the information he supplied . 
1	96	 But the major question that everyone wants to know is - why did the killer do it ? 
1	96	 What was his motive ? 
1	96	 At this point , the FBI Investigator took the microphone . 
1	96	 Instead of providing any information relevant to the mass murder - suicide , he berated everyone there and the millions watching on TV . 
1	96	 The Special Agent In Charge for the Las Vegas Division of the FBI said : 
1	96	 Our resolve is firm . 
1	96	 We will get to the bottom of this no matter how long it takes … we must focus on facts . 
1	96	 We can not give into conjecture . 
1	96	 We can not respond to every little Twitter feed that may indicate a theory . 
1	96	 We need to be focused on the facts . 
1	96	 You need us to be right . 
1	96	 You expect us to be right and we want to be right … . 
1	96	 After interviewing the killer 's girlfriend and God knows what else the FBI has uncovered , they provide nothing . 
1	96	 The FBI 's lack of transparency along with the corrupt and criminal acts by former FBI Directors lead all of America to begin forming conspiracy theories and to further lose trust in the FBI . 
1	96	 It 's time that the FBI cleans shop and restores it name and reputation .

1	98	"On the left , and among Donald Trump 's conservative critics , a new debate has emerged : is the media to blame for the businessman 's rise , or are Republican primary voters simply "" idiots , "" as New York Magazine 's Jon Chait argued recently , and unable to recognize a con - artist when they see one ? "
1	98	 This is a false choice . 
1	98	 There are plenty of factors that went into Trump becoming the presumptive GOP nominee , and the incessant media coverage of his every utterance and movement probably contributed to his sky - high negatives . 
1	98	 But it 's unserious , not to mention smug , to assume that Trump has been playing all of his Republican supporters for dupes . 
1	98	 You do n't need to worship Trump to vote for him . 
1	98	 You do n't even have to like him , or think he 's always honest , because these are not the factors at the heart of Trump 's appeal . 
1	98	" Consider this from Michael Cooper , a writer , attorney , and liberal Democrat who lives in rural North Carolina . "" "
1	98	 My Republican friends are for Trump . 
1	98	" My state representative is for Trump , "" he wrote in U.S. News in March . "" "
1	98	 People who have n't voted in years are for Trump . 
1	98	 He 'll win the primary here on March 15 and he will carry this county in the general . 
1	98	 His supporters realize he 's a joke . 
1	98	 They do not care . 
1	98	" They know he 's authoritarian , nationalist , almost un - American , and they love him anyway , because he disrupts a broken political process and beats establishment candidates who 've long ignored their interests . "" "
1	98	 This , I think , nicely sums up the core of Trump 's support . 
1	98	 Yes , there is a cult of personality around the candidate , and some of his backers do seem to think of him as a man who can do no wrong . 
1	98	 But the breadth of Trump 's support alone indicates that we 're dealing with more than just full - fledged # TrumpTrain devotees . 
1	98	 We 're also dealing with the people Cooper writes about , the ones who are n't so enthralled with the man himself but recognize him as a change agent . 
1	98	 And the truth is that a President Trump would , of course , be a change agent . 
1	98	 A Hillary win would likely take us to something like the pre - Trump status quo ante , which is one reason why so many D.C. and Wall Street Republicans will wind up supporting her -- they 'll still know how to play the game in a second Clinton presidency . 
1	98	 The notable Republicans who are n't supporting Donald Trump 
1	98	 A Trump victory , meanwhile , will undoubtedly lead to profound upheaval in our political system . 
1	98	 The policies he 'll pursue in office are still something of a mystery , but due to his lack of a real , grounding political philosophy , we can assume that he 'll embrace positions to both the right- and left - of - center . 
1	98	 In effect this would be something like a third party in American politics , and one in control of the White House no less -- a Party of Trump , which will find itself at odds with both stalwart conservatives like Ben Sasse and progressives like Elizabeth Warren . 
1	98	 Occasionally he 'll find common cause with one side , and sometimes with the other . 
1	98	 You could even see him putting together odd bedfellows like Sherrod Brown and Jeff Sessions to pass new restrictions on trade . 
1	98	 Any way you look at it , he would scramble everything we know about American politics . 
1	98	 You can argue that the changes that Trump would bring to this country would be disastrous , or that he 's morally and intellectually unfit for the office . 
1	98	 But the one safe bet we have about a Trump presidency is that it would provoke a realignment in our politics and bring about an end to the elite governing consensus of the last several decades . 
1	98	 America 's many establishments -- Republican and Democrat , liberal and conservative - would all suddenly find themselves on the outs . 
1	98	" The Democrats have signaled that they 'll run on the idea that a Trump presidency is just too "" risky "" and "" dangerous . "" "
1	98	 But that shows a real misunderstanding of his appeal as a candidate . 
1	98	 The subtext of every Trump rally is basically take this risk , take this gamble -- it may all end in tears , but it 's worth a shot . 
1	98	 America is n't working anymore , his argument goes . 
1	98	 It 's not working for Americans , Americans know that , and all those smug elites are to blame . 
1	98	 How do we fix that ? 
1	98	 Hard to say : Trump , remember , has a habit of contradicting himself within the same sentence when answering questions about his policy specifics . 
1	98	 But step one is blowing up the system , and that 's exactly what Trump is promising to do . 
1	98	 Is it childish to want the political system to be completely upended even if the consequences might be disastrous ? 
1	98	 Maybe . 
1	98	" But in a country where a plurality of Americans think that "" people like them "" were better off 50 years ago , at least according to a recent Pew survey , it should also be expected . "
1	98	 We can dismiss Trump 's voters as low - class , knuckle - dragging racists who deserve , in some sense , to suffer . 
1	98	 But that would n't be wise from a governing standpoint or , for Trump 's opponents , a tactical one . 
1	98	" If you think that Trump 's voters do n't get what 's best for them , then it 's up to you to sell them on why they 're wrong -- to make the case that free trade leads to cheaper , better goods for everyone , that immigration greatly benefits the economy , that a "" Muslim ban "" is immoral and would only help groups like ISIS . "
1	98	 That the system , for all its faults , can still be reformed , and that allowing Trump to raise hell in Washington will only make his supporters ' lot worse . 
1	98	" But to just dismiss them as "" idiots "" is , well , stupid . "
1	98	 It plays into his hands ; it justifies the anti - elite impulse he 's exploited . 
1	98	 The consensus among all the poll - watchers and data - heads who have consistently underestimated Trump from the onset is that Hillary is all but certain to win in November . 
1	98	 And they might be right . 
1	98	 But if Trump pulls off the upset , the smugness and lack of empathy that defines too many of his detractors will be in large part to blame .COMMENTARY : Donald Trump , candidate of change

0	100	TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) -- Attackers have mounted simultaneous gun and suicide bomb assaults on Iran 's parliament building and the tomb of the republic 's revolutionary founder in Tehran . 
0	100	 At least seven people were killed and 35 others injured in the twin assaults , the semi - official Fars agency reported . 
0	100	 The attacks were the most audacious 
0	100	 State media reported that gunmen stormed the parliament building in Tehran and went on a shooting spree . 
0	100	 At least one attacker detonated a suicide bomb . 
0	100	 Five people died and at least 25 were injured there , Fars reported . 
0	100	 At the same time , a gun and suicide bomb attack targeted the Ayatollah Khomeini mausoleum on the southern outskirts of the Iranian capital . 
0	100	 Two people died and 10 were injured at the shrine , Fars said . 
0	100	 A woman was arrested after the attack at the tomb , Fars reported , adding that another attacker has been surrounded by security officers . 
0	100	 CNN has not independently verified the number of victims and it was not immediately clear whether the number of dead included the suicide bombers . 
0	100	 The attackers were holding a number of hostages inside the highly - fortified parliament building , Press TV reported , as Iranian officials scrambled to establish who was behind the attacks or whether they were coordinated . 
0	100	 A picture from semi - official Fars news agency shows a man lowering a young boy from a window of the parliament building onto the street as another man holding a gun watches over them from another window . 
0	100	 The man with the gun is reportedly a policeman helping with the evacuation . 
0	100	 Attacks of this nature are extremely rare in Iran , particularly in the highly - controlled capital where tourist and government sites are tightly policed . 
0	100	 Gun ownership is heavily controlled in Iran , raising speculation that the attackers ' guns were smuggled into the country . 
0	100	 Symbolic attack 
0	100	 Iran 's parliament , also called the Islamic Consultative Assembly or Majlis , has 290 members . 
0	100	 It has female members and has representatives for religious minorities including Christians , Zoroastrians and Jews . 
0	100	 It is currently unclear how the attacker or attackers entered the parliament building , which has multiple security checkpoints . 
0	100	 The location of the mausoleum attack is symbolic , targeting the tomb of the Islamic Republic 's founder and first supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . 
0	100	 He led the revolution that overthrew the Shah in 1979 and was Iran 's leader for 10 years . 
0	100	 The mausoleum is located around 25 kilometers ( 15 miles ) from the parliament . 
0	100	 Attacks rare 
0	100	 Such attacks in Iran are rare , but the country -- with its largely Shiite population -- has been involved in military actions against Sunni terrorist groups such as ISIS , who regard Shiites as apostates . 
0	100	" Last year , Iran 's government said it thwarted "" one of the biggest plots "" by terror groups targeting Tehran and other major cities during the month of Ramadan . "
0	100	 This year 's holy month started almost two weeks ago on May 26 . 
0	100	 The last major attack in Iran was in 2010 when a Sunni extremist group carried out a suicide attack against a mosque in Sistan - Baluchistan killing 39 people . 
0	100	 Kurdish groups have carried out small scale attacks against Iranian security forces in the north - west of the country .

1	101	 You can see where this is headed , the once bright and shiny democracy going down the drain before the holidays are out . 
1	101	 The Russians , the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and his agents , desperate men flipped and singing to save their souls — all may soon be gone , by President Trump 's design . 
1	101	 If there 's any outrage left in the tank , use it now , because Trump has signaled exactly what he 's going to do . 
1	101	 First , he had to set some brush fires , impugning the legitimacy of the rule of law — an old dictator 's trick . 
1	101	 Trump is no Hitler , but when the German Reichstag burned in 1933 , it was all the Nazis needed to gut civil liberties . 
1	101	 So , before Trump can fire the prosecutor who is hot on the corruption trail of those in the president 's inner circle , he needs a pretext . 
1	101	 He could just work his way down the line at the Justice Department , until he found a quisling willing to remove the special counsel . 
1	101	 But before he gets to that , he has to delegitimize the whole investigation . 
1	101	" Thus , he 's now attacking the F.B.I. , saying the agency is in "" Tatters "" and its standing "" the worst in History . "" "
1	101	 Bashing cops — was n't that what those Black Lives Matter people did to disrespect Blue Lives ? 
1	101	" Thank God we have Sarah Huckabee Sanders as a moral clarion in a crisis . "" "
1	101	" When you 're attacking F.B.I. agents because you 're under criminal investigation , you 're losing , "" she tweeted . "
1	101	 Sorry — that was Sarah Huckabee Sanders of a year ago , before she was paid to defend the liar in chief . 
1	101	 Trump 's lawyer , John Dowd , has been busy clearing out more brush , making the preposterous claim that the president can not obstruct justice because he 's the nation 's chief law enforcement officer . 
1	101	 If Trump shot somebody on Fifth Avenue — his own suggested redline — he could , as the nation 's chief law enforcement officer , tell the cops to quash the investigation . 
1	101	 See , when the president does it , it 's not a crime . 
1	101	 This defense was floated during the two impeachment episodes of the 20th century . 
1	101	 The third time will not be a charm . 
1	101	 But Trump 's team already has gone from there is no collusion or obstruction to , so what ? 
1	101	 If it happened , it 's no biggie . 
1	101	 They do n't appear to be the least bit troubled by a stunning report from a whistle - blower . 
1	101	 As Trump was pledging to put America first during his Inaugural Address , his national security adviser , Michael Flynn , was texting a former business associate serving foreign clients . 
1	101	" With Trump in , the sanctions against Russia would be "" ripped up , "" clearing the way for big money to be made on the inside , according to the report made public Wednesday . "
1	101	 Ignoring that story , Trump 's media wing is doing its job . 
1	101	 Sean Hannity , at state - run television , went on a vein - popping rant Tuesday against law enforcement , complete with conspiracy charts . 
1	101	" He called the federal authorities "" a team of so - called investigators . "" "
1	101	" As for their boss , he said that "" Mueller is frankly a disgrace to the American justice system and has put the country on the brink of becoming a banana republic . "" "
1	101	 He 's certainly learned the art of projection from his master . 
1	101	 The Wall Street Journal , channeling its owner and Trump whisperer Rupert Murdoch , has been making much of the same case , albeit without the spittle . 
1	101	 Do n't forget , this is the same Robert Mueller who won wide bipartisan praise when he was appointed special counsel : a career prosecutor , the longest - serving director of the F.B.I. since J. Edgar Hoover , awarded the Bronze Star for his service as a Marine in Vietnam . 
1	101	 Republicans love him . 
1	101	 Or they did until he started closing in on Trump 's closest associates . 
1	101	 Mueller should be fired , the Russian enablers now claim , because one of his agents said some bad things about Trump . 
1	101	 This agent , Peter Strzok , was reassigned over the summer , as soon as his comments came to light . 
1	101	 Wow , a G - man has opinions . 
1	101	 The cops I know , a couple of longstanding friends , have more opinions than I. 
1	101	 The facts are what matter . 
1	101	 And the facts are pointing in a very bad direction for the gang that ca n't collude straight . 
1	101	" Trump has got to be sweating it ; he was said to be "" seething "" when two of his campaign aides were indicted and a third pleaded guilty in October . "
1	101	 He looked punch - drunk at recent public events . 
1	101	 Now that he 's a felon from a guilty plea last week , Flynn is cooperating with Mueller . 
1	101	 He knows plenty . 
1	101	 Trump could pardon him and try to bring him back into the fold . 
1	101	 The outrage would be minimal among the Banana Republicans . 
1	101	 Sure , they got their tax - relief - for - the - rich bill passed , so they may no longer need Trump after he signs it . 
1	101	 But now they 're dreaming of more — cutting Medicare and health care for children , so they have a reason to keep him around . 
1	101	 If Trump fires Mueller , he can start the new year clean . 
1	101	 His base will stick with him . 
1	101	 Though voters believe , by a nearly 2 - 1 margin , that Russians interfered with the United States election , Republicans do not . 
1	101	 Party before country — in the face of a dangerous turn toward authoritarianism , that 's all that matters .Trumpocalypse : The End Game
1	102	There was a break - in at Stephen Paddock 's Reno home on Sunday . 
1	102	 Local police say they were called to the home by a neighbor who says they saw the lights on . 
1	102	 RT reported : 
1	102	 FBI agents returned to search a house in Reno owned by Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock after local police told them that someone had broken into the home over the weekend . 
1	102	" Reno police officer Tim Broadway told The Associated Press , "" Nobody really saw anything , just a light was on with nobody in the residence . "" "
1	102	" Broadway said officers discovered that "" someone had broken into the house "" and he immediately contacted the FBI . "
1	102	 He added that the suspects broke into the home through the front door over the weekend , but said he was not sure exactly how they gained entry . 
1	102	 Police are not aware of any damages or anything that was stolen . 
1	102	 There are no suspects at this time or any descriptions of a suspect . 
1	102	 According to KOLOtv investigators searched Paddock 's Reno home on October 3rd and found firearms . 
1	102	" At a news conference Tuesday afternoon , Investigators said they found five handguns , two shotguns and a "" plethora of ammunition "" and electronics . "
1	102	 The house is being treated as a potential crime scene . 
1	102	 At least some of the guns found on Paddock 's properties had been bought at the Cabela 's store in Verdi . 
1	102	 We ca n't even trust the FBI at this point so who knows what really happened with this ‘ break - in ' . 
1	102	 The current Head of the FBI in Las Vegas was appointed by former FBI Head and now admitted leaker James Comey . 
1	102	 Is this why the investigation is such a mess ? 
1	102	 The investigation into the events and the motive behind the Las Vegas shooting last Sunday night is in flux . 
1	102	 To date no motive is provided by the FBI and local police . 
1	102	 Last week a press conference was held jointly by the FBI and the local Sheriff in Las Vegas concerning the recent murder of at least 59 people in that city . 
1	102	 The Sheriff appeared transparent in the information he supplied . 
1	102	 But the major question that everyone wanted to know was - why did the killer do it ? 
1	102	 What was his motive ? 
1	102	 Monday we found out that the killer shot the security guardbefore he fired on the crowd of people . 
1	102	 This directly contradicts with the earlier report that the security guard found the room of the killer and stopped him from shooting on the crowd . 
1	102	 As a result many more questions are raised like - Why the change in story ? 
1	102	 Why did the killer ever stop shooting on the crowd if the security guard did not stop him ? 
1	102	 The FBI 's lack of transparency along with the corrupt and criminal acts by former FBI Directors lead all of America to begin forming conspiracy theories and to further lose trust in the FBI . 
1	102	 In a significant timeline change , Sheriff Lombardo reveals Mandalay Bay security guard , Jesus Campos , was shot BEFORE the Las Vegas attack started .

1	104	 Modal Trigger 
1	104	 Then - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrives to speak on Sept. 12 , 2012 , on the killing of US Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three staff members at the US Consulate building in Benghazi , Libya , from the Treaty Room of the State Department . 
1	104	 Hillary Clinton boasts that her experience traveling to 112 countries as secretary of state qualifies her to be president . 
1	104	 Do n't believe it . 
1	104	 Evidence shows she left the State Department in shambles and our nation weaker . 
1	104	 Her record at Foggy Bottom disqualifies her to be president . 
1	104	" Her failures go beyond leaving four Americans to die in Benghazi on Sept. 11 , 2012 , the ridiculous Russian "" reset "" and the carnage in Syria that she and President Obama idly watched unfold — and that gets more horrific daily . "
1	104	 A string of investigative reports from the Obama administration shows that she botched key management jobs as secretary of state , threatening American lives and our diplomatic secrets . 
1	104	 Clinton 's State Department repeatedly rebuffed requests for additional security for the vulnerable compound at Benghazi , Libya . 
1	104	 The result ? 
1	104	 Heavily armed terrorists were able to storm the compound and kill Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans . 
1	104	 But Benghazi was n't an isolated case . 
1	104	 Clinton failed to secure diplomatic posts in Pakistan , Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , and other global hot spots . 
1	104	 Internal State Department reports show the posts lacked emergency plans in case of attack . 
1	104	 Guards assigned to them had no training in chemical or biological threats and , amazingly , some had n't undergone background checks . 
1	104	 Clinton tried to weasel out of taking the blame for Benghazi , testifying to Congress that she was n't personally involved in embassy security . 
1	104	 But emails later revealed that was false . 
1	104	 Investigators also point to Clinton 's total neglect of cybersecurity . 
1	104	 The Bush administration — reeling from the attack on the World Trade Center — had made it a top priority to protect information flow among embassies , the CIA and the FBI . 
1	104	" But Clinton dropped the ball , creating what the department 's inspector general called "" undue risk in the management of information . "" "
1	104	" In November 2013 , the IG issued an alert to the State Department 's top executives about the urgent "" recurring weaknesses "" in cybersecurity that had been red - flagged in six previous reports between 2011 and 2013 , almost all on Clinton 's watch . "
1	104	" The "" recurring weaknesses "" had still not been addressed , including vulnerabilities to hackers . "
1	104	 One of those previous reports — from July 2013 ( shortly after Clinton 's departure ) — described how much of the cybersecurity work was actually being done by contractors rather than department staff , contrary to government policy . 
1	104	 John Bentel , in charge of State 's cybersecurity during Clinton 's tenure , is one of the five State Department staffers who demanded immunity before talking to FBI investigators about Clinton 's private - server scheme . 
1	104	 He apparently took his duties regarding Clinton 's secret server more seriously than his duties to safeguard national cybersecurity . 
1	104	" According to an IG report , Bentel "" instructed his subordinates not to discuss the secretary 's email . "" "
1	104	" Rudy Giuliani said on Saturday Clinton 's use of a private email service for official business was like taking "" all our top - secret material and throwing it out on Fifth Avenue . "" "
1	104	 Outrageous , but still a lesser offense than Clinton 's neglect of the entire department 's digital security — exposing communications between thousands of agents and diplomats across the globe . 
1	104	 Even after WikiLeaks released 250,000 confidential State Department documents in 2010 , Clinton did n't plug the obvious holes in State 's cyber setup . 
1	104	 Yet during Monday 's debate , Clinton had the nerve to claim that she takes threats to the nation 's cybersecurity very seriously . 
1	104	 That 's a laugh . 
1	104	 Hillary 's management of finances at State was also slipshod , according to inspector general reports that point to a whopping $ 6 billion unaccounted for during her tenure . 
1	104	" Clinton 's chaotic mismanagement created "" conditions conducive to fraud , "" the IG warned , and made it harder "" to punish and deter criminal behavior . "" "
1	104	 She must have felt right at home . 
1	104	 True to Clinton 's instinct to cover up problems rather than fix them , she thwarted several investigations of sexual misconduct and prostitution at State . 
1	104	" Investigators complained of "" an appearance of undue influence and favoritism . "" "
1	104	 So what are the odds Hillary would run the federal government with integrity , keep the nation safe and get taxpayers more for their money ? 
1	104	 Zero .

1	111	How many disasters must Puerto Rico suffer ? 
1	111	 After Hurricane Maria tore through the Puerto Rico , President Donald Trump was extremely slow to acknowledge that the U.S. territory was in dire need of aid . 
1	111	 When Trump finally decided it was time to visit these Americans in need , his trip was a disaster in itself . 
1	111	 Here are some of the shockingly insensitive , incompetent and tone - deaf things Trump said during his trip to Puerto Rico : 
1	111	 1 . 
1	111	 Endless Self - Promotion 
1	111	 Despite criticism from Puerto Rican leaders and the fact that only 32 percent of Americans approve of how he 's handled the disaster , Trump has spent much of his time on the island insisting that everything has been going terrifically ! 
1	111	" "" I think it 's now acknowledged what a great job we 've done , "" he said . "" "
1	111	" In Texas and in Florida , we get an A+ , and I 'll tell you what : I think we 've done just as good in Puerto Rico . "" "
1	111	" "" We only heard thank yous from the people of Puerto Rico , "" he told another reporter . "
1	111	 Here 's an idea : rather than telling people what a great job he 's done , Trump should actually just do a great job , and then the people of Puerto Rico will do the complimenting for him . 
1	111	 2 . 
1	111	 Depicting Puerto Ricans As Lazy 
1	111	" Trump played upon an old , terrible stereotype of Latino laziness when he alleged that Puerto Ricans "" want everything to be done for them . "" "
1	111	 According to Trump in the same tweet , the leadership of Puerto Rico was ineffective and they could n't manage to get their own people to participate in the relief work . 
1	111	 This comment is as dog whistle - y as racist dog whistles get , which is why it 's entirely fair that internet commenters started sharing this photo en masse to remind Trump who exactly likes to have everything to be done for him : 
1	111	 3 . 
1	111	" Trump Is "" In the Dark "" About What 's Happening "
1	111	" While handing out flashlights to hurricane survivors , Trump could n't help but comment on the supposed pointlessness of the exercise . "" "
1	111	" Flashlights ? "" "
1	111	" he said aloud . "" "
1	111	 You do n't need ‘ em anymore . 
1	111	" You do n't need ‘ em . "" "
1	111	 Why Trump felt the need to say that is unclear , especially since at that point 95 percent of Puerto Rico was still without electricity . 
1	111	 Maybe Trump was being taken to places with power , but the vast majority of Puerto Ricans could really use those flashlights to , you know , see at night . 
1	111	" 4 . "" "
1	111	" Playfully "" Tossing Supplies "
1	111	 At least he was n't physically throwing the flashlights at the people of Puerto Rico . 
1	111	 During another moment , Trump began tossing paper towel rolls one at a time to the crowd . 
1	111	 It 's not only an inefficient manner of distributing supplies to people in need of resources , it 's a pretty degrading one . 
1	111	 As much as Trump may fancy himself some sort of rock star , these are n't fans attending a concert looking for free merchandise . 
1	111	 Technically , Trump did n't say anything in this instance , but the disrespect spoke volumes in his actions alone . 
1	111	 5 . 
1	111	 Making Puerto Rico Feel Like an Imposition 
1	111	 The nerve of Puerto Rico to have a hurricane - do n't they know how expensive recovery efforts are ? 
1	111	" Trump made sure they were well aware at a press briefing on the island . "" "
1	111	" I hate to tell you , Puerto Rico , but you threw our budget a little out of whack , "" he said . "
1	111	 Hahaha , what a funny joke , right ? 
1	111	 The president did n't make residents of Texas or Florida feel like they were a waste of money , so it seems extra suspect for the president to say something like this after already treating Puerto Ricans as lesser American citizens . 
1	111	 6 . 
1	111	 Minimizing the Scale of the Disaster 
1	111	 In the face of his initial inaction , Trump has repeatedly tried to downplay the scale of Hurricane Maria . 
1	111	" While speaking to Puerto Rican officials he said , "" If you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds of people that died … "" Trump said . "
1	111	" Sorry , there 's no need to finish that sentence , did Trump just really suggest a place experiencing massive devastation was not a "" real catastrophe "" ? "
1	111	" It 's true that the death count in Puerto Rico is significantly lower than that of Hurricane Katrina , but if that 's enough to make Trump "" proud "" ( his own words ) of how he 's handled this crisis , he 's completely off base . "
1	111	 7 . 
1	111	 Wiping Out Debt - But Not Really 
1	111	" In an interview on Tuesday , Trump told Fox News that to help Puerto Rico , he was going to "" wipe out "" their existing debt . "" "
1	111	" You can wave goodbye to that , "" he said . "
1	111	 Honestly , it was one of the most productive ideas to come out of the Trump administration throughout the disaster … too bad it seems that Trump was babbling without having consulted with his staff who are not on board with this idea . 
1	111	" Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney backtracked on the president 's comments saying , "" I would n't take it word for word with that , "" insisting that the White House would instead focus on providing disaster relief . "

0	113	 In fourteen hundred and ninety two , Columbus sailed the ocean blue … . 
0	113	 Today , Christopher Columbus is celebrated as a mythical hero by some - complete with songs , poems , and fictional tales about his great adventure across the Atlantic to explore the majestic land that would eventually be known as the Americas . 
0	113	 There are fifty four communities named after the explorer in the United States , including the District of Columbia .  
0	113	" Hail , Columbia "" was the United States ' unofficial national anthem until 1931 . "
0	113	" A federal holiday , "" Columbus Day , "" is celebrated every second Monday in October . "
0	113	 Despite all of this , historians have begun to tear down the Columbus myth : That he discovered America . 
0	113	 That he proved the world was n't flat . ( 
0	113	 That had been well - known for more than a millennium in Columbus ' time . 
0	113	" In fact , scholars had a pretty good idea of what the circumference of the Earth was , which was part of the dissent against Columbus making his trip- Columbus thought Asia was bigger than it is and the world much smaller , leading one of the scholars commissioned by the monarchy to investigate the plausibility of Columbus ' journey succeeding to say , it was "" impossible to any educated person "" ) . "
0	113	 That he came to America in the name of exploration . 
0	113	 And , finally , that he came in peace . 
0	113	" Quite simply , most of these "" facts "" are unequivocally false or half - truths . "
0	113	 Columbus sailed the ocean blue to look for wealth and , officially , in the name of Christianity . 
0	113	 What he mostly did , though , was enslave and rape the natives he met , sold girls ( as young as nine by his own account ) into prostitution , and committed numerous acts so heinous that he was forcibly removed from power and sent back to Spain in chains . 
0	113	" Christopher Columbus was brutal , even by the standards of his age , leading Bartolome de las Casa , who accompanied Columbus on one of his voyages , to write in his The History of the Indies , "" Such inhumanities and barbarisms were committed in my sight as no age can parallel … My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature that now I tremble as I write . "" "
0	113	" In August 1492 , Columbus departed Spain with three ships - the Santa Maria , the Pinta , and the Santa Clara ( nicknamed "" the Nina "" ) . "
0	113	 After two months on the high seas , land was spotted . 
0	113	 Now , before they had left , King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella had promised to whoever spotted land first a reward of a silken jacket and an annuity of ten thousand maravedis . 
0	113	 The lookout on the Pinta was Rodrigo de Triana and he was the first to spot land . 
0	113	 He shouted to the rest of the crew down below , and the Pinta 's captain announced the discovery with cannon fire . 
0	113	" When it came time to receive the reward though , Columbus claimed he actually saw a light in the distance several hours prior to Triana 's shout , "" but it was so indistinct that I did not dare to affirm it was land . "" "
0	113	 The reward reportedly went to Columbus . 
0	113	 Upon landing on the island , which he would call San Salvador ( present - day Bahamas ) , Columbus immediately went to work finding gold and enslaving the native populations . 
0	113	 Specifically , Columbus , upon seeing the Arawaks ( the peoples of the region ) come out of the forests frightened of the men with swords , but bearing gifts , wrote in his journal , 
0	113	 They do not bear arms , and do not know them , for I showed them a sword , they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance . 
0	113	 They would make fine servants . . . 
0	113	 with fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want . 
0	113	 As other European visitors would observe , the Arawaks were legendary for their hospitality and their desire to share . 
0	113	" Again saying Columbus about the Arawaks , "" are so naive and so free with their possessions that no one who has not witnessed them would believe it . "
0	113	 When you ask for something they have , they never say no . 
0	113	" To the contrary , they offer to share with anyone . "" "
0	113	 Columbus quickly took advantage of this . 
0	113	 Seeing that they wore gold studs in their ears , he rounded up of a number of Arawaks and had them lead him to where gold was . 
0	113	" The journey took them to present day Cuba and Haiti ( but Columbus thought it was Asia ) , where they found specks of gold in the river , but not the enormous "" fields "" Columbus was expecting . "
0	113	" Nonetheless , he wrote back to Spain saying that , "" There are many spices , and great mines of gold and other metals . "" "
0	113	 This report earned him financing for a second voyage , this time with 13 ships and twelve hundred men . 
0	113	" While he never ended up filling up these ships with gold , he filled them with another "" currency "" and one that would have a horrendous effect on the world going forward - slaves . "
0	113	 In 1495 , Columbus arrived back in the New World and immediately took 1500 Arawaks as prisoners . 
0	113	 Of those 1500 , he picked 500 to be shipped back to Spain as slaves ( about two hundred died on the journey back ) , starting the transatlantic slave trade . 
0	113	 The rest were forced to find what little gold existed in the region . 
0	113	 According to noted historian Howard Zinn , anyone over 14 had to meet a gold quota . 
0	113	 If they did n't find enough gold , they would have their hands cut off . 
0	113	 Eventually , when it was realized there was n't much gold in the region , Columbus and his men just took the rest as slaves and put them to work on their newly established estates in the region . 
0	113	 Many natives died and their numbers dwindled . 
0	113	 In the 15th century , modern historians believe there were about 300,000 Arawaks . 
0	113	 By 1515 , there were only 50,000 left . 
0	113	 By 1531 , 600 and by 1650 , there were no longer any full - blooded Arawaks left on the islands . 
0	113	 The way Columbus and his men treated the women and children of these populations was even worse . 
0	113	" Columbus routinely used the raping of women as a "" reward "" for his lieutenants . "
0	113	" For example , here 's an account from one of Columbus ' friends and compatriots , Michele de Cuneo , who accompanied Columbus on his second journey to the New World , on what Michele did to a native "" Carb woman . "" "
0	113	 Michele wrote that , 
0	113	 While I was in the boat I captured a very beautiful Carib woman , whom the said Lord Admiral [ Columbus ] gave to me , and with whom , having taken her into my cabin , she being naked according to their custom , I conceived desire to take pleasure . 
0	113	 I wanted to put my desire into execution but she did not want it and treated me with her finger nails in such a manner that I wished I had never begun . 
0	113	 But seeing that ( to tell you the end of it all ) , I took a rope and thrashed her well , for which she raised such unheard of screams that you would not have believed your ears . 
0	113	 Finally we came to an agreement in such manner that I can tell you that she seemed to have been brought up in a school of whores … 
0	113	 Going further , Columbus wrote in a letter from 1500 , 
0	113	 A hundred castellanos are as easily obtained for a woman as for a farm , and it is very general and there are plenty of dealers who go about looking for girls ; those from nine to ten are now in demand . 
0	113	 As illustrated in a recently discovered 48 page report found in the Spanish archives written by Francisco De Bobadilla ( charged with investigating Columbus ' rule at the behest of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand , who were troubled by allegations of some of Columbus ' acts ) , a woman who verbally insulted Columbus ' family was stripped naked and made to ride around the colony on a mule . 
0	113	 After the trip was done , her tongue was cut out by the order of Columbus ' brother , Bartolomé , who Columbus then congratulated for successfully defending the family 's honor . 
0	113	 Needless to say , these and numerous other such acts ultimately resulted in De Bobadilla having Columbus removed from power and sent back to Spain in chains . 
0	113	 After Columbus came , and was forced out , the Spaniards continued his policy of enslavement and violence . 
0	113	 In 1552 , the Spanish historian and friar Bartolome de las Casas published multiple volumes under the title The History of Indies . 
0	113	 In it , he described the collapse of the non - European population . 
0	113	 Casas writes that when the men were captured and forced to work in mines looking for gold , rarely if ever returning home , it significantly impacted the birth rate . 
0	113	 If a woman did give birth , she would be so overworked herself and malnourished , that she often could not produce enough milk for the baby . 
0	113	" He even reported that some of the women "" drowned their babies from sheer desperation . "" "
0	113	 There are lot more examples , writings , and research that points to one fact - Christopher Columbus was a lamentable individual . 
0	113	 Nobody 's perfect- if we restricted celebrated individuals to those who did n't have any major flaws , we 'd have few humans to celebrate- and it 's extremely important to view things in the context of the time individuals lived in . 
0	113	 But even in his age , many of his acts were considered deplorable by his peers , which is in no small part why Columbus was arrested for his conduct in the New World . 
0	113	 Combined with his truly historic and widespread impact being incidental to what he was actually trying to do ( so a little hard to celebrate him for even that side of his life ) , maybe it is time that we let go of the myths we learned about Christopher Columbus in elementary school and stop celebrating Columbus , the man .

0	113	 Not surprisingly , due to these many sexual encounters with the natives , STDs ran rampant in the region in Columbus ' time . 
0	113	 Further , while it is still somewhat up for debate if Columbus and his crew brought syphilis to the New World or if they brought it from the New World to Europe ( the latter generally being the favored theory ) , what is n't argued is that Columbus inadvertently quickened and widen the spread of these dangerous diseases on both sides of the Atlantic .

1	114	"President Donald Trump 's nominee for federal judge in Alabama was just approved by every Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee — even though he was unanimously rated "" not qualified "" by the American Bar Association . "
1	114	" Brett J. Talley is 36 years old , has only practiced law for three years and made a series of partisan comments on his blog in 2016 that would normally be considered unbecoming of a judge , like referring to the Democratic presidential candidate as "" Hillary Rotten Clinton , "" according to the Los Angeles Times . "
1	114	 Although Talley does have degrees from the University of Alabama and Harvard Law School and clerked for two federal judges , he has never argued a motion , making it nearly unprecedented for him to be considered as a candidate for a lifetime appointment . 
1	114	" One of Talley 's most controversial statements was a blog post in which he claimed that President Barack Obama was "" about to launch the greatest attack on our constitutional freedoms in our lifetime . "" "
1	114	" He added , "" The object of that war is to make guns illegal , in all forms . "" "
1	114	" After a commenter wrote that Americans would "" resort to arms when our other rights — of speech , press , assembly , representative government — fail to yield the desired results , "" Talley said he agreed with him . "
1	114	" When asked about these statements by the Senate Judiciary Committee , Talley said he was merely "" trying to generate discussion . "
1	114	" I wanted people to be able to use my blog to discuss issues , to come together and find common ground . "" "
1	114	" The president has directly praised Talley as being an "" untold story "" that "" nobody wants to talk about . "" "
1	114	" "" When you think of it , Mitch [ McConnell ] and I were saying , that has consequences 40 years out , depending on the age of the judge , "" Trump said in October . "" "
1	114	" But 40 years out . "" "
1	114	 One other factor that may have contributed to Talley 's nomination : He was mentored by Sen. Luther Strange of Alabama and worked in the Justice Department office that chooses judicial nominees . 
1	114	 Talley is n't the only Trump judicial nominee who has been the subject of raised questions . 
1	114	" Charles Goodwin , who was nominated to the federal bench in Oklahoma , was the first judicial nominee since 2006 to receive a "" not qualified "" label from the American Bar Association . "

0	115	And the Trump chronicles continue . 
0	115	 Presidential hopeful Donald Trump said he supports creating a mandatory database to track Muslims in the United States . 
0	115	" "" I would certainly implement that . "
0	115	" Absolutely , "" Trump , 69 , told NBC News between campaign events on Thursday in Newton , Iowa . "
0	115	" "" There should be a lot of systems , beyond databases . "
0	115	" We should have a lot of systems . "" "
0	115	" When asked by the reporter whether Muslims would be legally obligated to register in the database , the business mogul responded : "" They have to be . "
0	115	" They have to be . "" "
0	115	" He said that the country 's Muslims would register for the database at "" different places , "" adding , "" It 's all about management . "" "
0	115	 The comments come less than a week after terrorists wreaked havoc on the French capital , taking the lives of at least 129 people and injuring more than 300 others in a series of coordinated attacks . 
0	115	 The attacks have prompted calls for new restrictions on accepting Syrian refugees . 
0	115	 On Thursday , the House passed a bill to drastically tighten screening procedures on Syrian refugees , requiring key national security agencies to determine whether each Iraqi and Syrian refugee poses a threat , CNN reports . 
0	115	 The White House vowed that President Barack Obama would veto the bill . 
0	115	 Trump 's recent comments stem from an earlier interview with Yahoo News on Thursday in which he did not reject the idea of requiring Muslims in the U.S. to register into a database or present a special ID that noted their religion . 
0	115	" "" We 're going to have to look at a lot of things very closely , "" the 69-year - old said . "" "
0	115	" We 're going to have to look at the mosques . "" "
0	115	" The Council on American - Islamic Relations criticized the candidate for the comments in a statement on Thursday , and a council spokesman told NBC , "" We 're kind of at a loss for words , "" adding that the database plan is comparable to that of prewar Nazi Germany . "
0	115	" However , when a reporter asked Trump about the difference between Muslim databases and requiring Jews to register in Nazi Germany , Trump replied , "" You tell me . "" "
0	115	 He did not answer when asked what consequences would be implemented for Muslims who refused to register . 
0	115	" He later denied responding to questions regarding a potential Muslim database at all , adding that he did n't "" know where you heard that . "" "

0	115	" However , he says , America should provide a "" safe haven "" for Christian refugees . "

0	117	" We are here to support and endorse what he has been doing for the military and the economy , "" said Sajid Tarar , a Muslim immigrant from Pakistan and founder of Muslim Americans for Trump . "
0	117	 The rally comes at a time of intense controversy for the president . 
0	117	 An ABC News / Washington Post poll from this month showed 66 percent of Americans said Trump has done more to divide the country than unite it . 
0	117	 He recently criticized NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality against African - Americans . 
0	117	 And the rally was held the same day as marches with speakers expected to be critical of the president were staged across the country in support of racial justice . 
0	117	 Another is planned Sunday at Lawyers Mall . 
0	117	 But Saturday , the crowd outside the State House had a different message . 
0	117	 The rally , co - sponsored by Muslim Americans for Trump and Sikh Americans for Trump , was intended to bring together minority communities not typically associated with Trump 's largely white base and demonstrate support for Trump 's ideas . 
0	117	 Tarar has been a vocal Trump supporter from early on ; he prayed onstage at the Republican National Convention and spoke favor of the then - candidate . 
0	117	 Trump 's statements about Muslims and Islam are not directed at the faith as a whole , Tarar said , nor at every Muslim American .

0	117	" "" As a Muslim , I saw him as a relief . "
0	117	" I saw him as the person who can fight the terrorism , "" Tarar said . "
0	117	 He said Trump 's travel ban , which originally blocked immigrants from Iran , Syria , Libya , Somalia , Yemen and Sudan , is n't a ban at all but a pause , to ensure thorough vetting of the people from these countries . 
0	117	 The original restriction on travel from these six countries has expired and been replaced with an order that bans varying degrees of immigration from Chad , Iran , Libya , North Korea , Somalia , Syria , Venezuela and Yemen . 
0	117	" Tarar and Sikh Americans for Trump founder Jesse Singh both immigrated to the U.S. — "" legally , "" Singh told the crowd . "

0	117	 When I came to Dulles Airport , the same 30-year - old bus with loose doors and torn carpet came to receive me .

0	117	" At one point , a "" Build that wall ! "" "
0	117	 chant briefly broke out among the rallygoers . 
0	117	 Garcia - Hidalgo spoke of a booming economy , a low unemployment rate and a strong stock market , and defended Trump 's response to the devastation to Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria . 
0	117	 Michael Cohen , who serves as Trump 's personal lawyer , also spoke at the rally via phone and thanked those gathered for their support . 
0	117	 Congress has not yet approved funding for the border wall , but the Trump administration has announced companies that are building prototypes . 
0	117	 Additionally , Congress has not passed any economic legislation , but the administration introduced a tax reform plan Wednesday . 
0	117	 Maryland is a predominantly blue state . 
0	117	 More than 60 percent of state voters cast ballots for Hillary Clinton in the last presidential election , and she edged Trump by 6,016 votes in Anne Arundel County .

0	118	Even Jerry Springer Thinks This Election Is Too Much 
0	118	 © 2016 Bloomberg Finance LP

0	118	 You can see it , almost : Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton sitting just a few steps from each other onstage , going at each other 's throats . 
0	118	" "" It 's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country , "" Clinton levels . "
0	118	" Trump cuts in with a threat : "" Because you 'd be in jail . "" "
0	118	 The audience goes wild , collectively gasping , then cheering , either for their audacious , say - it - like - it - is savior , or because they 're just thrilled with the entertainment . 
0	118	 Maybe a chair gets thrown . 
0	118	 It 's not hard for Jerry Springer to picture some of the crazier moments from the 2016 presidential election on the set of his eponymous talk show . 
0	118	" After all , the Jerry Springer Show traffics in drama and dysfunction , and that ugly scene — minus the chair throwing — played out live at the second presidential debate last week , one of the most brutal in recent history . "" "

0	118	 Faced with the prospect of a Trump presidency , Springer , a former Democratic mayor of Cincinnati who once ran for governor of Ohio , has thrown his hat back in the political ring to make the case for Clinton . 
0	118	" Last month , he tweeted his assessment of the options facing the American people : "" Hillary Clinton belongs in the White House . "

0	118	 Be honest : Do you ever feel like thwacking Trump with a folding chair ?

0	118	 You know , they 're always pulling off the wig ? 
0	118	 That 's why he would n't come on the show .

0	118	 The problem with him doing my show is you 've got to be able to tell the difference between a host and the guests . 
0	118	" So they would have to run a graphic , they would have to keep saying , "" He 's the host , he 's the host , he 's the host . "" "
0	118	 But other than that , yeah , he 's phenomenal on television . 
0	118	 You 're an ardent Hillary Clinton supporter . 
0	118	" Aside from "" she 's not a demagogue , "" what 's your case for her ? "
0	118	 Certainly in my lifetime , there 's never been a human being more prepared , and more knowledgeable and more balanced to be president of the United States who has n't already been one . 
0	118	 In other words , when you run for reelection for president , you already know all of the world issues . 
0	118	 But for someone who has n't yet been president , I do n't think there 's another human being that could sit down with her and would know as much about what 's going on in the world , has thought more about all these issues for her whole lifetime , than she has . 
0	118	 She really is the most qualified person ever to run for president who has n't been president before . 
0	118	 And there 's no particular benefit for me other than I love my country . 
0	118	 I mean , I 'm not looking for a political job . 
0	118	 I 'm literally just a citizen . 
0	118	 And I do take it seriously . 
0	118	 I 'm [ from ] an immigrant family . 
0	118	 So I take the State of Liberty very seriously . 
0	118	 I mean , my family was lost in the Holocaust . 
0	118	 We believe in the State of Liberty . 
0	118	 This was the place we were going to come . 
0	118	 And then you have someone running for president who is opposed to the idea [ of ] America ? 
0	118	 Religious , ethnic and all that kind of freedom ? 
0	118	 And wants to replace the State of Liberty with a wall ? 
0	118	 So I compare that to the qualifications of a Hillary . 
0	118	 You 've talked about how the election is personal for you . 
0	118	 How does it hit home ? 
0	118	" Someone comes to me and says , "" Well , if you knew Trump , he is n't personally bigoted . "" "
0	118	 It does n't matter — that 's irrelevant . 
0	118	 He 's smart enough to know that he is giving cover , he is giving voice to a very ugly notion that you will be judged in this country based on where you 're from and what your religion is , what your ethnicity is , and in some instances , even what your color is . 
0	118	 And gender . 
0	118	 And your disabilities , if you have any . 
0	118	 Well , we all have some disabilities . 
0	118	 But it 's , like , oh my god , this is so un - American . 
0	118	 It 's , like , a cruel irony to say we 're going to make America great again . 
0	118	 Hey ! 
0	118	 First understand what America is . 
0	118	 That is personal . 
0	118	 You 're the former mayor of Cincinnati . 
0	118	 What have you learned about politics in the two decades you 've been doing your show that you did n't know during your political career ? 
0	118	 I always knew we were all alike and the only thing that separated us [ is ] some of us were luckier in the gene pool of parents , and some of us had more money , and stuff like that . 
0	118	 And I saw that in politics , and I see it in the people on my show . ... 
0	118	 99 percent of what we are , we had nothing to do with . 
0	118	 Not one person you will ever meet had anything to do with the decision to be born , to whom you 'd be born , what kind of health , what kind of brain , what era , what country . 
0	118	 None of this stuff . 
0	118	 The last one percent of what we become is maybe due to our own efforts . 
0	118	 But even that is based on what we were born with . 
0	118	 If you understand that , then you will never ever judge people based on what they are . 
0	118	 You will only judge people based on what they do . 
0	118	 I guess I kind of knew that all along , and every job I 've ever had just confirmed what I 've always believed , is that human beings are alike . 
0	118	 Some are just luckier . 
0	118	 Your show is in its 26th season— 
0	118	 I apologize . [ 
0	118	 laughs ] I 'm sorry . 
0	118	 I 've ruined the culture . 
0	118	 I 'm so sorry . 
0	118	 Oh , please , Rebecca , forgive me . 
0	118	 I forgive you ! 
0	118	 What 's one moment from this election that would have been way better on your stage ? 
0	118	 Well , any of the debates , clearly . 
0	118	 And obviously the video . 
0	118	 I mean , really . 
0	118	 You ca n't even make a parody of it anymore . 
0	118	 I can't — it 's almost , they 're throwing softballs at me . 
0	118	" It 's , like , "" Hey ! "
0	118	" Here 's a show topic , here 's a show topic . "" "
0	118	 I mean , I could have done a whole season of shows just on this campaign . 
0	118	" But again , it 's one thing to have a television [ show ] about that , which is the purpose of the show , to have it about dysfunctional behavior , and another thing to say , "" Gee , why does n't the person on this show run for president ? "" "
0	118	 What ? 
0	118	 Who thought that was a good idea ? 
0	118	 You 've said Trump 's blurring of politics and entertainment helped propel him to the GOP nomination . 
0	118	 Are shows like yours to blame for Trump 's rise ? 
0	118	 No , no one show . 
0	118	 Lots of people watch the show and behave properly .Even Jerry Springer Thinks This Election Is Too Much
0	119	Hillary Clinton speaks during a rally in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . ( 
0	119	 Getty ) 
0	119	 Hillary Clinton is beginning to increase her odds of winning Florida in many election forecasts , while other models say that Donald Trump is now likely to capture the state . 
0	119	 On November 6th , FiveThirtyEight was forecasting a Donald Trump victory in Florida , giving him a 52.5 percent chance of winning . 
0	119	 The state has flipped from red to blue in the past 24 hours ; as of November 7th , the FiveThirtyEight model now gives Donald Trump a 48.5 percent chance of winning Florida , with Hillary Clinton having the better odds of 51.6 percent . 
0	119	 On their forecast , we can see a clear dip that occurs in the immediate aftermath of the news that the FBI would be looking into new emails relevant to the Hillary Clinton investigation , but now her lead is beginning to rise again . 
0	119	 FiveThirtyEight is also forecasting that Hillary Clinton will win 48.2 percent of the popular vote in Florida , while Donald Trump will receive 48.0 percent of it . 
0	119	 But in The New York Times ' The Upshot , Florida is actually beginning to move in Donald Trump 's direction . 
0	119	 On November 6th , the Times ' model gave Hillary Clinton a 70 percent chance of winning the state , but now , this number has gone down to 66 percent . 
0	119	 And two weeks ago , before the FBI news was released , Hillary Clinton had an 80 percent chance of winning Florida on The Upshot . 
0	119	 The model currently gives Clinton an 84 percent chance of becoming the next president . 
0	119	 Clearly , Clinton does not absolutely need Florida to win , while Donald Trump almost certainly ca n't reach 270 Electoral College votes without it . 
0	119	 On PredictWise , Hillary Clinton now has better odds of winning Florida than she did yesterday . 
0	119	 On November 6th , Clinton was given a 73 percent chance of winning Florida by PredictWise , but now that has gone up two points to 75 percent . 
0	119	 Surprisingly , PredictWise is actually giving Clinton better odds of winning Florida today than she had prior to the FBI announcement on October 28th . 
0	119	 Hours before that news dropped , Clinton 's odds of winning Florida were at 72 percent . 
0	119	 In the aftermath of that bombshell , her odds fell all the way down to 58 percent , but she has now more than recovered from it . 
0	119	 Nationally , PredictWise gives Clinton an 89 percent chance of winning the election , up two points since yesterday . 
0	119	 Meanwhile , a dramatic shift has taken place on The Huffington Post 's forecast . 
0	119	" On Sunday , this model gave Clinton a 93 percent chance of winning Florida , and the state was placed in the "" probable Clinton "" column . "
0	119	" Twenty - four hours later , Florida has been moved into the "" battleground "" column , and her odds of winning the state have dropped down to 89 percent . "
0	119	" The Huffington Post has also moved North Carolina from "" probable Clinton "" into "" battleground . "" "
0	119	 One day ago , Clinton 's projected minimum number of Electoral College votes was 317 , but now that has dropped down to 273 . 
0	119	 Clinton has seen a very slight bump in DailyKos ‘ election forecast , though . 
0	119	 On November 6th , they gave her a 74 percent chance of winning Florida , but that has now gone up one point to 75 percent . 
0	119	 This bump also came as DailyKos released its final election prediction . 
0	119	 They expect Hillary Clinton to win 323 Electoral College votes - including that of North Carolina and Florida - and Donald Trump to win 215 votes . 
0	119	 It 's easy to see why all these shifts have taken place , as several key Florida polls were released on Monday that show the race to be much tighter than it was just one day ago . 
0	119	 Yesterday , Hillary Clinton was ahead in Real Clear Politics ' Florida polling average by 0.9 percentage points , but today , Trump leads by 0.3 percent . 
0	119	 No polls have yet been released that reflect the FBI 's recent announcement that they would still not be recommending charges against Hillary Clinton after reviewing the new set of e - mails , so it remains to be seen if Clinton will be able to recover even more of her lead in the aftermath of that news .

1	120	 Plastic is plaguing the environment left and right and one of the single biggest contributors is the use of single - use plastic bottles . 
1	120	 This includes water bottles and those used for other beverages , like sodas and sugary sports drinks , and the demand for them is only increasing despite global efforts to stem plastic usage in the bud . 
1	120	 Plastic bags and bottles ravage the Earth from production to disposal , and yet humans buy approximately one million bottles per minute , according to Euromonitor , a market research group . 
1	120	 Those numbers are expected to increase by another 20 % by 2021 , which will devastate climate , beaches , oceans , and all of the animals that reside in these areas . 
1	120	 According to figures from Euromonitor , humans bought 480 billion plastic bottles in the year 2016 , which is 300 billion more than the numbers from a decade ago . 
1	120	 To make matters worse , less than half of those bottles was collected for recycling and only about 7 % of those collected were turned into new bottles . 
1	120	 Manufacturers complain that using recycled plastic ruins the appeal of the bottles and that it costs more to use these materials , which will fall on the consumer . 
1	120	 Experts speculate that this demand for 20,000 bottles per second has been exacerbated by the on - the - go , urban culture that has taken over in cities in China and the Asia Pacific region . 
1	120	 With an increased population comes a rise in the demand for PET ( polyethylene terephthalate ) bottles , which is why Chinese citizens bought 73.8 billion bottles last year , up more than 5 billion since the year before it . 
1	120	" "" [ China ] is a critical country to understand when examining global sales of plastic PET bottles , and China 's requirement for plastic bottles continues to expand , "" said Euromonitor 's head of packaging , Rosemary Downey . "
1	120	 It 's not enough that reusable water bottles are trending right now because that does n't help the nations who ca n't trust the cleanliness of their tap water . 
1	120	 This surge in buying plastic bottles is also largely driven by developing countries , where disposability is more important than sustainability and being eco - friendly . 
1	120	" "" This increase is being driven by increased urbanization , "" Downey said . "" "
1	120	" There is a desire for healthy living and there are ongoing concerns about groundwater contamination and the quality of tap water , which all contribute to the increase in bottle water use . "" "

1	120	 If municipalities would clean up their water or work to provide safe drinking water to certain regions for the first time , it 's likely that plastic pollution , especially when it comes to bottles , would decline dramatically and slow the environmental health crisisthat is building every day . 
1	120	 Sadly , it 's estimated that approximately 5 to 13 million tons of plastic leak into the ocean every single year , ultimately to be worn down into fragments that float in the water column and can sometimes become a part of one of the many garbage patches . 
1	120	 Fish , sea birds , and other marine life will eat the specks of plastic or even consume larger pieces , which can eventually kill them . 
1	120	 Since humans consume a variety of fish from the ocean , these plastics can also make their way onto our dinner plates . 
1	120	" "" The plastic pollution crisis rivals the threat of climate change as it pollutes every natural system and an increasing number of organisms on planet Earth , "" said Hugo Tagholm , the CEO of Surfers Against Sewage . "" "
1	120	 Current science shows that plastics can not be usefully assimilated into the food chain . 
1	120	" Where they are ingested they carry toxins that work their way on to our dinner plates . "" "
1	120	 There are several solutions that groups and experts have suggested to reduce the number of plastic bottle usage , ranging from cutting bottles out cold turkey to encouraging a payment system to use plastic bottles . 
1	120	 While some places , like San Francisco , banned the sale of plastic bottles , other groups advocate for what 's called a circular economy . 
1	120	 In the circular economy , plastic bottles would be used , recycled , refilled , and reused , effectively reducing waste . 
1	120	 Surfers Against Sewage is currently campaigning for a deposit return system to be implemented in the UK , which the equivalent of CRV that is collected in the U.S. that can be returned to people that recycle their bottles or cans . 
1	120	 If you are n't compelled by these reasons to stop using plastic bottles , consider what your beaches will look like once plastic dominates the world even more . 
1	120	 Remote islands with little to no beach clean - ups have shown evidence of extreme pollution along their coast and upwards of 18 tons on their beaches , revealing what the future of even the nicest beaches will be . 
1	120	 Consider purchasing a reusable water bottle today and making a huge difference for the environment .Latest Figures Reveal That The World Uses 500 Billion Plastic Bottles Annually

1	121	 In response to Joyce Newman 's recent letter about a conversation about guns : According to the National Right to Life Organization , approximately 600,000 babies are murdered every year by Planned Parenthood with more than 52 million murdered since Roe v. Wade . 
1	121	 This makes Planned Parenthood the biggest mass murderer in the history of the world .

1	121	 Where is her outrage over that ?

1	122	 The Labor Day parades are over . 
1	122	 The bands have packed up . 
1	122	 The muscular speeches celebrating workers are finished . 
1	122	 The trash is getting collected from parks across the country . 
1	122	 And now conservative politicians from Trump on down will revive their systematic efforts to weaken unions and undermine workers . 
1	122	 Trump -- despite all the populist bunting that decorates his speeches -- sustains the deeply entrenched Republican antipathy to organized workers . 
1	122	 Their attack is relentless . 
1	122	 Trump 's budget calls for deep cuts in the Labor Department , eviscerating job training programs and cutting -- by 40 percent -- the agency that does research on workplace safety . 
1	122	 It would eliminate the program that funds education of workers on how to avoid workplace hazards . 
1	122	 It even savages money for mine safety enforcement for the miners Trump claims to love . 
1	122	 Trump is systematically reversing any Obama rule that aided workers . 
1	122	 He signed legislation scrapping the rule that required federal contractors to disclose violations of workplace safety and employment and anti - discrimination laws . 
1	122	 His Labor Secretary has announced his intention to strip millions of workers of the overtime pay they would have received under Obama DOL regulations . 
1	122	 Trump is creating a pro - business majority at the National Labor Relations Board , which will roll back Obama 's efforts to make it easier for workers to organize , and make it possible to hold home companies responsible for the employment practices of their franchisees . 
1	122	 The GOP 's Anti - Union Strategy 
1	122	 This is simply standard operating procedure for today 's Republican party . 
1	122	" Long ago , Republicans realized that organized labor was a central "" pillar , "" as Grover Norquist described it , of Democratic Party strength . "
1	122	 Now Republican office holders at every level -- from county officials to statehouses to judges -- know that their job is to weaken labor unions . 
1	122	 From right to work laws to administrative regulations to court challenges , Republicans sustain an unrelenting attack . 
1	122	 And aided by our perverse globalization strategies , they 've been remarkably successful . 
1	122	 Unions are down to about 7 percent of the private workforce . 
1	122	 Public employee unions , a relative stronghold , are facing court challenges -- essentially allowing workers to enjoy the benefits of union negotiations without paying dues -- that will decimate their membership . 
1	122	 True conservatives would embrace unions . 
1	122	" They are a classic "" mediating institution , "" a voluntary civic organization between government and the individual . "
1	122	 Unions increase the voice and power of workers in the workplace , helping to keep executive accountable , and to protect workers from abuse . 
1	122	 They also educate their members , teach democracy , and are central to community volunteer and service efforts . 
1	122	 They teach and practice democratic citizenship . 
1	122	 The modern Republican Party , of course , is the party of big business and big money . 
1	122	 It is n't conservative ; it is partisan . 
1	122	 And weakening unions is a constant target . 
1	122	 While Republicans understand how important unions are to Democrats and to workers , Democrats do n't seem to get it . 
1	122	 Sure , they line up to get union donations ; most will vote to defend unions and worker programs . 
1	122	 But as the money in politics has gotten bigger and the unions have gotten weaker , the Wall Street wing of the Democratic Party has become more powerful . 
1	122	 The result is clear . 
1	122	 When Republicans get control , they attack unions relentlessly . 
1	122	 When Democrats gain control , as they did in 2012 with the election of Barack Obama and Democratic majorities in both houses , labor law reform , empowering workers to organize is not a priority . 
1	122	 Obama essentially told unions that if they could get the votes , he 'd sign the law , but he was n't leading the charge . 
1	122	 And so as under Carter and Clinton , changing the law to make it easier for workers to organize and bargain collectively did n't happen . 
1	122	 Unions Under Siege 
1	122	 Now unions are under siege . 
1	122	" Yet it is hard to imagine how a small "" d "" democracy can be robust , or a large "" D "" Democratic Party can regain its mojo without a revived movement of workers . "
1	122	 It 's time for Democrats at every level to realize : strengthening workers and their unions is n't an elective ; it 's a requirement and a first priority . 
1	122	 The loop works like this : Unions are in decline . 
1	122	 As a result , unions lose influence inside the Democratic Party . 
1	122	 The Democrats then feel no pressure to stem unions ' decline , and the economically disadvantaged lose what was once their most powerful advocate . 
1	122	 Then the cycle continues . 
1	122	 We can not revive unions , and we have no template for egalitarian politics without them . 
1	122	 Unions are n't simply economic actors . 
1	122	 They 're political actors . 
1	122	 Labor still needs the Democrats . 
1	122	 The Democrats , more than they realize , still need labor . 
1	122	 But most of all , all those who want to build a fairer society need their partnership .

1	122	 Republican elites understand the doom loop . 
1	122	 Big business , small business , and Tea Party alike have pushed hard against unions . 
1	122	 As the parties have polarized , Republicans have taken the gloves off , risking the votes of the 40 percent of union members who back Republicans in order to crush a pillar of the Democratic coalition . 
1	122	 Even President Bernie Sanders would have real trouble rebuilding unions in the face of a Republican Congress and a federal judiciary eager to swat down pro - labor executive action . 
1	122	 Even without Republican politicians digging their graves , labor unions face deep challenges . 
1	122	 In the private sector , unions must sign contracts workplace by workplace . 
1	122	 Gawker writers here and home - care workers there will continue to organize their workplaces , but the barriers remain dauntingly high . 
1	122	 In the public sector , unions have stood steady . 
1	122	 But cops and teachers alike face blowback for putting their own prerogatives above the public interest . 
1	122	" And if the Supreme Court bans the collection of agency fees in the public sector ( thus imposing "" right to work "" ) , public - sector union membership could halve in a decade . "

1	122	 It 's time for Democrats at every level to realize : strengthening workers and their unions is n't an elective ; it 's a requirement and a first priority . 
1	122	 The loop works like this : Unions are in decline . 
1	122	 As a result , unions lose influence inside the Democratic Party . 
1	122	 The Democrats then feel no pressure to stem unions ' decline , and the economically disadvantaged lose what was once their most powerful advocate . 
1	122	 Then the cycle continues . 
1	122	 We can not revive unions , and we have no template for egalitarian politics without them . 
1	122	 Unions are n't simply economic actors . 
1	122	 They 're political actors . 
1	122	 Labor still needs the Democrats . 
1	122	 The Democrats , more than they realize , still need labor .

0	123	Following the latest FBI developments in Hillary Clinton 's email probe , Donald Trump ripped the Justice Department and top Clinton aide Huma Abedin on Saturday , firing off a tirade during his triumphant swing through western states . 
0	123	" "" It 's reported today , this morning that the Department of Justice was fighting the FBI , "" Trump said in Golden , Colorado . "" "
0	123	" And that 's because the Department of Justice is trying so hard to protect Hillary . "" "
0	123	 Trump was referencing reports that Attorney General Loretta Lynch recommended that FBI Director James Comey not publicly disclose the new emails -- what the Justice Department viewed as a violation of its long - standing practice not to comment on ongoing investigations . 
0	123	" "" There are those , and I happen to be one of them , who think Hillary offered Loretta Lynch a reappointment as attorney general . "
0	123	" I happen to be one of them , "" Trump said . "
0	123	 Offering no proof , the Republican nominee posited that Clinton 's husband , former President Bill Clinton , had bribed Lynch with the position when the two had an impromptu meeting earlier this summer on a plane in Arizona . 
0	123	 The two met just days before the FBI completed its probe into the private email server . 
0	123	" "" Perhaps , just perhaps , of course he said he only talked about golf and the grandchildren , but he was on the plane for 39 minutes , he went to Arizona , an unbelievable place , but there are those who think when he went onto the plane that 's what he discussed just prior to a decision being made , "" Trump said . "
0	123	 The New York real estate mogul then trained his biting attacks on Abedin and her husband , former Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner . 
0	123	 The emails tied to the Clinton probe were found on the separated couple 's electronic devices from a separate FBI investigation into Weiner 's sexting scandal . 
0	123	" "" Did I call him correctly , did anybody see ? "" "
0	123	" Trump asked , pointing to his prior criticisms of Weiner . "" "
0	123	 It 's called good judgement , it 's called good instincts . 
0	123	 If you check out the tweets , or if you check out whatever it is I wrote about him , it is so perfect , I said . 
0	123	" And that was done a long time ago , but they found , by looking at Anthony Weiner , a major , major , major sleaze , they found what may be some of the 33,000 missing and deleted emails . "" "
0	123	 Trump has , in the past , wondered whether Abedin was a national security concern because of her relationship to Weiner . 
0	123	" "" [ Abedin 's ] receiving very , very important information and giving it to Hillary . "
0	123	" Who else is she giving it to ? "" "
0	123	" Trump said back in August . "" "
0	123	 Her husband has serious problems and on top of that , he now works for a public relations firm ... So how can she be married to this guy who 's got these major problems ? 
0	123	 She 's getting her most important information , it could be , in the world . 
0	123	 Who knows what he 's going to do with it ? 
0	123	" Forget about her . "" "
0	123	 Trump 's speculation on what the newly surfaced emails contained , however , remains unfounded . 
0	123	 The FBI has yet to release any further details about the information found in the emails . 
0	123	 Clinton 's campaign , in the meantime , has defended Abedin , with campaign chair John Podesta telling reporters on a conference call that the staff stands behind her . 
0	123	" "" There 's no evidence of wrongdoing , no charge of wrongdoing , no indication that this was even about Hillary , "" Podesta said Saturday . "
0	123	" He added that Comey 's letter to top Republicans in the House and Senate was "" long on innuendo and short on facts . "" "
0	123	" Podesta added that Comey knew "" full well what Republicans in Congress would do with it "" and blasted House Oversight Committee Chair Jason Chaffetz , R - Utah , in particular for taking "" the opportunity to distort the facts . "" "

0	124	"Donald Trump defended past disparaging remarks about women during Thursday 's GOP debate , saying he does n't have time for "" total political correctness "" and that oftentimes he 's just kidding . "
0	124	" "" You 've called women you do n't like fat pigs , dogs , slobs and disgusting animals , "" Fox News debate moderator Megyn Kelly told Trump . "
0	124	" "" Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president , "" she added . "
0	124	 Trump said those comments were directed at TV personality Rosie O'Donnell , who has publicly feuded with Trump in the past . 
0	124	" "" I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct . "

1	125	" Be careful , Lyin ' Ted , or I will spill the beans on your wife ! "" "
1	125	" Trump followed up his initial comment by retweeting an unflattering photo comparing Heidi Cruz with his wife , Melania , stating , "" A picture is worth a thousand words . "" "
1	125	" It was reported in the same story that a friend of Diana , Selina Scott , said the princess felt stalked after her divorce from Prince Charles ; Trump "" bombarded Diana at Kensington Palace with massive bouquets of flowers . "" "
1	125	" In a tweet that Trump later deleted , he wrote on April 16 , 2016 : "" If Hillary Clinton ca n't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America ? "" "
1	125	" In December 2015 , Trump said Clinton "" got schlonged "" by President Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential primaries . "
1	125	 In doing so , he turned the Yiddish word for penis into a verb . 
1	125	" According to CNN , Yiddish scholars were shocked by the word 's use in a "" filthy "" context . "
1	125	" Trump condemned Clinton for "" shouting "" during her appeal to female voters . "
1	125	 In an MSNBC interview , he acknowledged that he was using gendered terms when referencing Clinton 's decibel level . 
1	125	" Trump has also criticized her credentials for president by saying , "" Frankly , if Hillary Clinton were a man , I do n't think she 'd get 5 percent of the vote . "

1	125	 It was Donald Trump 's affair with Marla Maples that led to his divorce from Ivana Trump . 
1	125	 The couple married in 1993 and divorced six years later in 1999 . 
1	125	 It was Trump 's relationship with Maples that also provided fodder for recently resurfaced allegations that Trump posed as his own public relations rep in interviews with various publications . 
1	125	" In a 1991 phone interviewwith People magazine reporter Sue Carswell , a recording of which was released in May 2016 , a rep who identified himself as "" John Miller "" explained why Trump had left Maples for Italian singer - model Carla Bruni . "

1	125	" According to Carswell , Trump later apologized for the ruse , saying it was a "" joke gone awry , "" though he currently denies he ever posed as his own rep . "
1	125	" In the recording of the phone conversation , "" Miller "" -- whose tone , cadence and style of speaking are all remarkably Trump - like -- gave intimate details of Trump 's encounters with celebrities like Italian singer and model Carla Bruni and pop star Madonna . "

1	131	 In Chicano history , the women who formed a vital part of social justice movements have often been swept aside ; forgotten or ignored as their male counterparts receive the bulk of the praise for their collective work . 
1	131	 Their visibility is imperative as Chicanas continue to work in social justice , fighting the good fights within various movements . 
1	131	" "" Chicana Tributes : Activist Women of the Civil Rights Movement "" aims to share those untold stories of the women who formed an important part of the movement . "
1	131	 CREDIT : Chicana Tributes / San Diego State University Chicano Archive 
1	131	 The book documents the experiences of 61 Chicanas from the ' 60s to the present who have paved the way in the fight for human rights as educators , attorneys , activists , artists and more . 
1	131	 Some of the women featured have passed , while others remain active . 
1	131	 Each of their stories were written by an author of their or their loved ones ' choosing , creating beautiful pieces that bring together women for the purpose of honoring women . 
1	131	 The project came about by the Chicano Archive Committee at San Diego State University , which works to document the people and historical events that have occurred around the Chicano movement . 
1	131	" Committee members and co - editors Sonia Lopez and Rita Sanchez selected the women featured in "" Chicana Tributes "" to document what they believe is missing from the history books . "
1	131	" "" These stories need to be told so people can know that some of the things they take for granted , a lot of people fought for , "" says Lopez . "" "
1	131	 Most of the time , the men are the ones who are recognized . 
1	131	" Any advancement in the Chicano community , the credit is mostly given to the men . "" "
1	131	 Lopez , a longtime activist and educator , was the first person to teach a Chicana history class at San Diego State back in 1972 . 
1	131	 Back then , she found a need to address Chicana issues , and still sees the need today . 
1	131	" "" There 's still not enough information on Chicanas that have contributed to history , society and the community , "" she says . "" "
1	131	" They need to be recognized . "" "
1	131	 Among the women featured are ACLU leader Norma Chavez , Laura Rodriguez , matriarch of the National Historic Landmark Chicano Park , Charlotte Hernandez Terry , the first woman to paint a mural at Chicano Park , and Delia Moreno , who along with her daughters form Trio Moreno , which played protest trio music during important events in the Chicano movement . 
1	131	 In telling the stories of these trailblazers , Lopez says young women will have one more book they can see themselves in , which is necessary as there are few books that offer that . 
1	131	 Especially as the women featured have overcome many struggles in their life and come out on top . 
1	131	" "" It 's amazing that these women still had the courage and resilience in spite of all their hardships , "" Lopez says . "" "
1	131	 We 're trying to teach people this is life . 
1	131	 Life is a struggle . 
1	131	 Part of becoming who you are is a struggle . 
1	131	 And for us , especially , as Mexicanas on this side of the border . 
1	131	 We chose the word ‘ chicana ' to define our own identity , tell our history , tell our story and tell our roots . 
1	131	" By reading this story people will learn , people will appreciate and feel inspired . "" "
1	131	" "" I think young women today are looking for role models , "" she adds . "" "
1	131	 I do n't feel that we have enough role models out there of people that are doing things or have done things to inspire , to motivate . 
1	131	 With this book , young women can see that it 's possible to do . 
1	131	" The groundwork has been laid by the women featured in this book . "" "

0	132	Almost a half - century ago , in 1968 , the United States seemed to be falling apart . 
0	132	 The Vietnam War , a bitter and close presidential election , antiwar protests , racial riots , political assassinations , terrorism and a recession looming on the horizon left the country divided between a loud radical minority and a silent conservative majority . 
0	132	 The United States avoided a civil war . 
0	132	 But America suffered a collective psychological depression , civil unrest , defeat in Vietnam and assorted disasters for the next decade -- until the election of a once - polarizing Ronald Reagan ushered in five consecutive presidential terms of relative bipartisan calm and prosperity from 1981 to 2001 . 
0	132	 It appears as if 2017 might be another 1968 . 
0	132	 Recent traumatic hurricanes seem to reflect the country 's human turmoil . 
0	132	 After the polarizing Obama presidency and the contested election of Donald Trump , the country is once again split in two . 
0	132	 But this time the divide is far deeper , both ideologically and geographically -- and more 50/50 , with the two liberal coasts pitted against red - state America in between . 
0	132	 Century - old mute stone statues are torn down in the dead of night , apparently on the theory that by attacking the Confederate dead , the lives of the living might improve . 
0	132	 All the old standbys of American life seem to be eroding . 
0	132	 The National Football League is imploding as it devolves into a political circus . 
0	132	 Multimillionaire players refuse to stand for the national anthem , turning off millions of fans whose former loyalties paid their salaries . 
0	132	 Politics -- or rather a progressive hatred of the provocative Donald Trump -- permeates almost every nook and cranny of popular culture . 
0	132	 The new allegiance of the media , late - night television , stand - up comedy , Hollywood , professional sports and universities is committed to liberal sermonizing . 
0	132	 Politically correct obscenity and vulgarity among celebrities and entertainers is a substitute for talent , even as Hollywood is wracked by sexual harassment scandals and other perversities . 
0	132	" The smears "" racist , "" "" fascist , "" "" white privilege "" and "" Nazi "" -- like "" commie "" of the 1950s -- are so overused as to become meaningless . "
0	132	 There is now less free speech on campus than during the McCarthy era of the early 1950s . 
0	132	 As was the case in 1968 , the world abroad is also falling apart . 
0	132	 The European Union , model of the future , is unraveling . 
0	132	 The EU has been paralyzed by the exit of Great Britain , the divide between Spain and Catalonia , the bankruptcy of Mediterranean nation members , insidious terrorist attacks in major European cities and the onslaught of millions of immigrants -- mostly young , male and Muslim -- from the war - torn Middle East . 
0	132	 Germany is once again becoming imperious , but this time insidiously by means other than arms . 
0	132	 The failed state of North Korea claims that it has nuclear - tipped missiles capable of reaching America 's West Coast -- and apparently wants some sort of bribe not to launch them . 
0	132	 Iran is likely to follow the North Korea nuclear trajectory . 
0	132	 In the meantime , its new Shiite hegemony in the Middle East is feeding on the carcasses of Syria and Iraq . 
0	132	 Is the chaos of 2017 a catharsis -- a necessary and long overdue purge of dangerous and neglected pathologies ? 
0	132	 Will the bedlam within the United States descend into more nihilism , or offer a remedy to the status quo that had divided and nearly bankrupted the country ? 
0	132	 Is the problem too much democracy , as the volatile and fickle mob runs roughshod over establishment experts and experienced bureaucrats ? 
0	132	 Or is the crisis too little democracy , as populists strive to dethrone a scandal - plagued , anti - democratic , incompetent and overrated entrenched elite ? 
0	132	 Neither traditional political party has any answers . 
0	132	 Democrats are being overwhelmed by the identity politics and socialism of progressives . 
0	132	 Republicans are torn asunder between upstart populist nationalists and the calcified establishment status quo . 
0	132	 Yet for all the social instability and media hysteria , life in the United States quietly seems to be getting better . 
0	132	 The economy is growing . 
0	132	 Unemployment and inflation remain low . 
0	132	 The stock market and middle - class incomes are up . 
0	132	 Business and consumer confidence are high . 
0	132	 Corporate profits are up . 
0	132	 Energy production has expanded . 
0	132	 The border with Mexico is being enforced . 
0	132	 Is the instability less a symptom that America is falling apart and more a sign that the loud conventional wisdom of the past -- about the benefits of a globalized economy , the insignificance of national borders and the importance of identity politics -- is drawing to a close , along with the careers of those who profited from it ? 
0	132	 In the past , any crisis that did not destroy the United States ended up making it stronger . 
0	132	 But for now , the fight grows over which is more toxic -- the chronic statist malady that was eating away the country , or the new populist medicine deemed necessary to cure it .

1	133	 Trashlive : Hours after a 32-year - old woman from Western Massachusetts fatally overdosed in Rhode Island on Monday , her father and brother were arrested in what police are calling a kidnapping and attack on her suspected heroin hookup . 
1	133	 Police arrived on Baldwin Hill Road in the small Berkshire County town of Egremont around 4:15 p.m. to find the late woman 's father allegedly choking and striking a struggling man while his son helped hold down his arms . 
1	133	" Both father and son were "" screaming different versions of ‘ you killed my [ expletive ] daughter ' and ‘ you killed my [ expletive ] sister , ' "" according to a report by Egremont Police Officer Hans Carlson , obtained Friday by MassLive . "
1	133	 The man was able to escape the slow - moving van on Baldwin Hill Road , whereupon both Lombardis allegedly followed him out and continued the attack , which residents of the street observed and reported to police , who intervened in a quick response . 
1	133	 I do n't normally condone vigilantism , but at the same time , we 're living in a state filled to the brim with Deval Patrick judges that let scumbags out onto the street time and time again . 
1	133	 Some times you just got ta do what you got ta do . 
1	133	 Nah mean ? 
1	133	 Big shoutout to this father and son duo who realized that this was the only way they were going to receive any sort of satisfaction . 
1	133	 There 's no way the idiot they kidnapped ever saw it coming either . 
1	133	 There 's a reason it was just the son that was supposed to show up . 
1	133	 The Dad looks like he done killed 4 - 5 people before . 
1	133	 Plus his name is Ralph . 
1	133	 I do n't fuck with guys named Ralph who wear shirts like that . 
1	133	 That 's just common sense . 
1	133	 Meanwhile the son appears to be your average Berkshire hippie jock who is no stranger to craft beer festivals : 
1	133	" Never in a million years did the "" victim "" think that guy right there was gon na kidnap him in a van and waterboard him to kingdom come until he named names . "
1	133	 I 've said it before and I 'll say it again - there is no one more gutless than a heroin dealer . 
1	133	 Pot dealers are great , and coke dealers I do n't have strong opinions on . 
1	133	 Know why ? 
1	133	 Because they do their own product . 
1	133	 Heroin dealers do n't . 
1	133	 Because they 'd be dead pretty quickly . 
1	133	 If you ca n't stand by your product then you 're a piece of shit . 
1	133	 People who sell heroin are choad monkeys because they KNOW they 're profiting off of the self - destruction of another person . 
1	133	 There has never , ever , ever been a positive affect of heroin . 
1	133	 Ever . 
1	133	 You are selling poison to stupid and vulnerable people who do n't know any better . 
1	133	 You are the lowest of the low . 
1	133	 Granted the guy they kicked the shit out of was n't the actual dealer . 
1	133	 But he knew who the dealer was and it was time to name names . 
1	133	 This is the only way to get that information . 
1	133	 Big props for doing it mafia style too by using a van , and telling the idiot they picked up that they were gon na magically fix his debt problems . 
1	133	 The only surprising part about this story is that they got caught in Egremont . 
1	133	 Egremont is easily top 5 places to dump a body in Massachusetts . 
1	133	 Ever been there before ? 
1	133	 It 's a real trip . 
1	133	 Nestled next to Alford , Mount Washington ( there 's a town called Mount Washington ) , New York state , and the metropolis of Great Barrington , there 's no reason for anyone to ever go to Egremont . 
1	133	 Ever . 
1	133	 The fact that this nudnik jumped out of the van and people were actually there to see it is nothing less than a statistical miracle . 
1	133	 I do n't wanna say that father and son are heroes , but they kind of just revolutionized the opiate epidemic . 
1	133	 If you sell heroin , you no longer get a free pass from some SJW judge . 
1	133	 You get old school punishment from the family . 
1	133	 At least that might present a detriment for potential dealers down the road . 
1	133	 We urge you to support the following local businesses . 
1	133	 They provide terrific services for the community !Shoutout To This Father - Son Duo Who Avenged Their Daughter / Sister 's Death By Kidnapping And Kicking The Shit Out Of Her Heroin Hookup Until He Named Names
1	134	Joe Arpaio , the 85-year - old disgraced former Arizona sheriff who recently announced his candidacy for a Senate seat in the same state , spewed the false and racist assertion on CNN that former President Barack Obama 's birth certificate is fabricated and that he was n't born in the United States . 
1	134	" "" No doubt about it . "
1	134	" No doubt about it , "" Arpaio told CNN 's Chris Cuomo after being asked if the birth certificate was a phony . "" "
1	134	 We have the evidence . 
1	134	" I 'm not going to go into all the detail , but yes , it 's a phony document . "" "

1	134	 The president pardoned Arpaio on Aug. 25 — a Friday night , when most of the nation 's attention had been focused on the arrival of Hurricane Harvey . 
1	134	 In his pardon , Trump praised Arpaio as a lifelong public servant who enforced the rule of law . 
1	134	" "" Arpaio 's life and career , which began at the age of 18 when he enlisted in the military after the outbreak of the Korean War , exemplify selfless public service , "" the statement said . "" "
1	134	 Throughout his time as Sheriff , Arpaio continued his life 's work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration . 
1	134	" Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now 85 years old , and after more than fifty years of admirable service to our Nation , he is worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon . "" "
1	134	 The former Maricopa County sheriff was convicted of criminal contempt of court in July , after a judge found that Arpaio had violated court orders to stop detaining undocumented immigrants , as Salon has previously reported . 
1	134	" Arpaio has a long and well documented history of abusive and racist law enforcement tactics and violated a court order "" to temporarily cease making immigration - related arrests after he was sued for racial profiling . "" "

1	135	Much of the ugliness we see on the Left today is embodied in groups like Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA . 
1	135	 Both groups think they are oppressed , both are obsessed with identity politics , and both are steeped in Marxist ideologies . 
1	135	 You 'd think that they would get along just fine but that 's not the case . 
1	135	 People who have their identities wrapped up in victimhood are narcissistic by nature .

0	136	Many Muslims are peaceful and tolerant , and it has become fashionable in the West to portray Islam as a peaceful and tolerant religion , even in the wake of terrorist attacks like the recent one in New York . 
0	136	 But it 's hard to buy into this charade when it comes to Muslim treatment of women under Sharia law . 
0	136	 Plainly put , Sharia subjugates women in virtually every area of their lives . 
0	136	 Hank Hanegraaff is president of the Christian Research Institute , and host of the national radio broadcast The Bible Answer Man . 
0	136	 Allah 's decrees enshrine inequality . 
0	136	 Although Allah allows a husband to beat his wife , there is no provision in the Qur'an for a wife to beat her husband . 
0	136	 Nor can she initiate a divorce . 
0	136	 Only men can do so , and with relative ease . 
0	136	" In "" Heretic , "" Ayaan Hirsi Ali explains the shackles of sharia for women , including "" the right of men to have unfettered sexual access to their wives , the right of men to practice polygamy , and the restriction of women 's legal rights in divorce cases , in estate law , in cases of rape , in court testimony , and in consent to marriage . "" "
0	136	 According to Sharia , women ( and little girls ) who are captives of war can be raped by their Muslim captors . 
0	136	 But girls who have sex outside of marriage are flogged , and women who commit adultery are stoned . 
0	136	 Two incidents almost 14 centuries apart show just how deeply the exploitation of women is ingrained In Sharia . 
0	136	 In August 2014 , after Muslim fighters captured Yazidi villages in the Sinjar region of northern Iraq , they executed the men and adolescent boys by spraying them with automatic - weapons fire . 
0	136	 What happened to women and children might truly have been worse . 
0	136	" As chronicled in the Islamic State on - line magazine "" Dabiq , "" "" After capture , the Yazidi women and children were then divided according to the Sharī'ah amongst the fighters of the Islamic State who participated in the Sinjar operations , after one fifth of the slaves were transferred to the Islamic State 's authority to be divided . "" "
0	136	" Captives were sent "" to Syria or to other locations inside Iraq , where they were bought and sold for sex . "" "
0	136	" According to a report in The New York Times , one of the captives , a 12-year - old Yazidi child , was raped by a devout Muslim fighter who "" took the time to explain that what he was about to do was not a sin . "
0	136	" Because the preteen girl practiced a religion other than Islam , the Quran not only gave him the right to rape her - it condoned and encouraged it . "" "
0	136	 Sadly , the victim was just one of countless thousands in the history of Islam . 
0	136	 In 627 , Muhammad and his fighters invaded the villages of the prosperous Banu Mustaliq Jewish tribe on the shores of the Red Sea . 
0	136	 As with the Yazidis , the Jewish men and boys murdered by Muhammad and his Muslim hordes were spared the unthinkable atrocities their loved ones were about to suffer . 
0	136	 In accordance with the law of Allah , many were raped , others sold as chattel . 
0	136	 Muhammad , revered by Muslims the world over as the founder of their religion , took a Jewish woman as booty after having her husband and hundreds more men beheaded . 
0	136	 Then he forced her on his bed and added her to his stable of wives and concubines . 
0	136	 Though the Yazidi and Mustaliq atrocities bookend nearly 1,400 years of Islamic history , their treatment of female captives was virtually identical . 
0	136	 Why ? 
0	136	" Because , as chronicled in "" Dabiq , "" what the Islamic State does in the 21st century is an authentic application of the teachings and practices of Muhammad . "
0	136	 Ayaan Hirsi Ali tells the horrifying story of a 13-year - old girl in Somalia who was found guilty of adultery after reporting that she had been raped by three men . 
0	136	 Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow - named after Muhammad 's 9-year - old wife - was dragged , screaming and flailing , into a sports stadium in Kismayo to be stoned . 
0	136	" "" It took four men to bury her up to her neck in the hole , "" Hirsi Ali wrote . "" "
0	136	 Then fifty men spent ten minutes pelting her with rocks and stones . 
0	136	 Then she was dug out of the ground and two nurses examined her to see if she was still alive . 
0	136	 Someone found a pulse and breathing . 
0	136	" Aisha was returned to the hole and the stoning continued . "" "
0	136	" After she died , "" a local sheik told a radio station that Aisha had provided evidence , confirmed her guilt , and ' was happy with the punishment under Islamic law . ' "" "

0	138	"Sebastian Gorka , who served seven months as deputy assistant to President Trump , alongside former chief strategist Steve Bannon , sat down with Circa to talk about his time in the White House , the "" deep state , "" the future of Trump 's Make America Great Again agenda and the Washington , D.C. "" bureaucratic swamp . "" "
0	138	 Question and Answer with Sebastian Gorka : 
0	138	" "" That 's why I predict that in the near future , before Christmas probably , there will be some very high - level personnel changes in the White House that are driven by the President . "" "
0	138	 Sara Carter : There 's a lot of supporters who are concerned now that with the departure of both you and Mr. Steve Bannon , that the MAGA ( Make America Great Again ) agenda is gone . 
0	138	 Is that true ? 
0	138	 Sebastian Gorka : No , not at all . 
0	138	 I know a lot of people are worried , a lot of people that , from the base felt that November the 8th was politically a revolutionary moment . 
0	138	" The fact that Steve left and then a week later I resigned , I always tell people "" relax . "" "
0	138	 Count to 10 . 
0	138	 Take a deep breath . 
0	138	 Whether or not the president 's agenda succeeds is n't a function of where I sit or where Steve has an office . 
0	138	 The president 's supporters are n't just individuals who have to be inside the White House . 
0	138	 They can be on the outside . 
0	138	 And what , what a lot of Steve 's critics did n't understand , who celebrated his resignation , Steve today is more powerful than he 's ever been . 
0	138	" It 's like that scene from "" Star Wars "" when Ben Kenobi gets slain by Darth Vader . "
0	138	 I will be more powerful than you can ever imagine . 
0	138	 Steve Bannon is now the most powerful man outside of the Oval Office in America . 
0	138	 I 'm not joking , he is , because there are things you can do , legal things -- OK , relax Huffington Post -- there are legal things that you can do as a private citizen that you can not do as a government employee . 
0	138	" "" Steve [ Bannon ] today is more powerful than he 's ever been . "
0	138	" It 's like that scene from Star Wars when Ben Kenobi gets slain by Darth Vader . "" "
0	138	 Sara Carter : But then access to the president , that 's also very important ? 
0	138	 Sebastian Gorka : Yes . 
0	138	 Sara Carter : So when you 're not in the White House , you 're outside the White House , how does that affect access ? 
0	138	 Sebastian Gorka : OK . 
0	138	 I 'm not gon na give away any inside baseball , but let me give you an example . 
0	138	 When I was deputy assistant to the president , I 'd walk in and out of the Oval Office and I 'd regularly see people like Corey Lewandowski , I 'd see Dave Bossie in the Oval [ Office ] with the President . 
0	138	 Now , neither of those individuals had a government ID card , neither of them worked for the White House , but they were in there with the president and I can assure you they were n't talking about the weather . 
0	138	 So , one thing to know about the president , he is very loyal to those who have been loyal to him . 
0	138	 And the idea that you can isolate Donald J. Trump from people he trusts who do n't happen to be inside the building is , of course , absurd . 
0	138	 So , the President talks to lots of different people and several of them do not work for the White House . 
0	138	 So relax . 
0	138	 View the slideshow 
0	138	 Sara Carter : This brings me to your resignation letter . 
0	138	 Sebastian Gorka : Yes . 
0	138	 Sara Carter : In your resignation letter you state that there are people ascendant within the White House that do not support the President 's MAGA agenda ? 
0	138	 Explain that , and who are these people ? 
0	138	 Sebastian Gorka : OK , so first things first , I 'd like to try and explain what was special about November the 8th . 
0	138	" And if you remember , there was a film , a great John Milius film called "" Red Dawn "" in the 80s about the Soviet Cuban invasion of America and the resistance that American patriots put up to it . "
0	138	 The president of the United States won against the whole establishment on November the 8th . 
0	138	 He was just accidentally the GOP 's candidate . 
0	138	 He had nothing to do with the swamp , nothing to do with the GOP , nobody took him seriously when he announced and what did he do ? 
0	138	 He proceeded to wipe the floor with 16 establishment GOP candidates and then defeat a woman who 'd officially spent $ 700 million on a position she thought was owed to her . 
0	138	" "" So what happened on November the 8th ? "
0	138	" It 's like the wolverines from Red Dawn , a scrappy bunch of insurgents defeated the mighty empire that is the swamp . "" "
0	138	 This is the rank outsider . 
0	138	 So what happened on November the 8th ? 
0	138	 It 's like the wolverines from Red Dawn , a scrappy bunch of insurgents defeated the mighty empire that is the swamp . 
0	138	 As a result , when we moved into the White House , Steve , myself , the president , it was the most leveraged , hostile takeover in political history in the modern age . 
0	138	 Because it was a small group of people that came in to run the largest government in the run . 
0	138	 Sorry , if you add the armed forces , millions of employees . 
0	138	 So , what happened is a natural event . 
0	138	 In the intervening months , the establishment figures reacted to the antibodies that represent the MAGA agenda and boxed us out , tried to cut us out of the policy agenda . 
0	138	 Fired a lot of the more junior people in the NSC . 
0	138	 That 's the point at which Steve and then later I realized look , uh , this is about eight years of President Trump and then eight years of President Pence . 
0	138	 We have to think about the long game . 
0	138	 And if right now we 're being undermined internally , what we do is we go on the outside and we support the agenda from the outside . 
0	138	 That 's why I became the chief strategist for the Make America Great Again Coalition . 
0	138	 That 's why Steve is doing all kinds of things right now . 
0	138	 That 's why I predict that in the near future , before Christmas probably , there will be some very high - level personnel changes in the White House that are driven by the president . 
0	138	 It 's important to know , apart from [ Robert ] Mueller -- he 's a holdover , ignore him -- every single , high - ranking or , or less than high - ranking firing in the last eight months was not driven by the president . 
0	138	 OK ? 
0	138	 All those people fired from the NSC , [ Anthony ] Scaramucci , these were people who were fired by people other than the president . 
0	138	 I think the president already realizes he 's being given bad advice on key issues . 
0	138	 The Alabama race tells you everything you need to know . 
0	138	 And now he 's going to get rid of some people who are n't on message and have nothing to do with the original agenda . 
0	138	 Take the quiz ! 
0	138	 Sara Carter : Would one of those people happen to be Secretary of State [ Rex ] Tillerson ? 
0	138	 Sebastian Gorka : The President reached out to me the day after I resigned . 
0	138	 He thanked me for my service . 
0	138	 He said he is gon na stick to the agenda and he 'd like me to support him from the outside . 
0	138	 That 's exactly what I 'm doing . 
0	138	 One of the things I promised myself I would n't do is attack individual members of the cabinet who are n't part of the agenda . 
0	138	 So , I 'm not gon na talk about individuals just yet , but I 'll talk about principles and the fact is , um , Tucker Carlson had a segment after Steve left the White House that I think is crucial to understanding the reality of what 's going on in the West Wing . 
0	138	 I do n't think Tucker Carlson is a big fan of Steve Bannon or Breitbart , I may be wrong , but he said one very trenchant thing . 
0	138	" He said , "" Whatever you think about Steve Bannon , there 's one thing that 's certain . "
0	138	" He would not be at home in a White House under Hillary Clinton . "" "
0	138	 There are people in the administration of Donald J. Trump who not only would have been at home in a Hillary Clinton White House , they would have been cabinet members in a Hillary White House . 
0	138	 So that 's the current problem , but again , relax . 
0	138	 It 's a temporary state of affairs . 
0	138	" "" There are people in the administration of Donald J. Trump who not only would have been at home in a Hillary Clinton White House , they would have been cabinet members in a Hillary White House . "" "
0	138	 Sara Carter : So the president is surrounded , in your opinion , by some people that would have been comfortable in a Hillary Clinton White House and may be pushing those agendas ? 
0	138	 Sebastian Gorka : The president has this sense , and I guarantee you right now , he knows who around him is now consistently giving him bad advice and sooner or later he will make decisions to remove those people from around him . 
0	138	" Sara Carter : Explain the "" deep state . "" "
0	138	" Sebastian Gorka : I 'm a little bit uncomfortable with the phrase "" deep state . "" "
0	138	 I love conspiracy theories but only as entertainment . 
0	138	 There 's a reason they 're called theories . 
0	138	 Conspiracy theories kill critical thought . 
0	138	" I prefer the phrase "" the deep state . "" "
0	138	 The deep state is n't a conspiracy theory , it 's a real thing . 
0	138	 Let me give you an example . 
0	138	 So , I did n't work in the NSC , I worked for Steve . 
0	138	 I was a strategist in the office , or the chief strategist to the president . 
0	138	 But because of my national security portfolio , I attended regular classified meetings with the NSC on whatever issue it was . 
0	138	 The Qatar crisis , the ISIS plan , you name it . 
0	138	 And a pattern developed in these meetings which is really disturbing and explains the permanent state . 
0	138	 You 're sitting in , a White House meeting that is the pinnacle of policy making in the most powerful nation in the world . 
0	138	 The NSC makes national security policy . 
0	138	 There 's nothing above it apart from , you know , the President and his National Security Advisor . 
0	138	 You sit there for an hour , an hour - and - a - half , with key members of the NSC , invited guests from the CIA , DIA , outstations from the Pentagon , you name it . 
0	138	 And for 90 minutes on a key issue , you did n't hear the name of the president . 
0	138	 You did n't hear mention of the president 's strategic objectives , and you did n't hear mention of what he said yesterday in Warsaw or Riyadh . 
0	138	" "" The swamp is much more . "
0	138	" The professional bureaucratic class in America that believes that they know better than the President elected by the people of America to run this country . "" "
0	138	" And it would be up to me , the guy with the funny accent , after 90 minutes to say , "" Uh , hey guys . "
0	138	 Did you hear what the President said yesterday in Riyadh about ISIS ? 
0	138	" Did you hear what the President said about NATO in Warsaw ? "" "
0	138	 This is what the president wants to achieve and we 're all gon na be on message , right ? 
0	138	 So what I saw is that the swamp is n't Capitol Hill . 
0	138	 A lot of people think the swamp is the political professional class of congressmen and women . 
0	138	 The swamp is much more . 
0	138	 The professional bureaucratic class in America that believes that they know better than the president elected by the people of America to run this country . 
0	138	" A GS14 , a GS15 who 's been at State Department or CIA for 20 years and thinks , "" Oh , I , I 've been doing this for so long . "
0	138	 I do n't care what the president says about Qatar , we need to do this . 
0	138	" I do n't care what the President says about X , Y , Z , we need to do this . "" "
0	138	 That undermines American democracy and that 's the permanent state , and that 's what we have to push back on if democracy is to thrive in America .

1	143	As we are writing this , Donald Trump is clothed in his war regalia as he prepares for a battle with the judiciary , the press , the CIA and probably innocent Americans . 
1	143	 The good news is that we have a powerful and high - ranking military officer is not going to let Trump oppress the world . 
1	143	 Air Force Chief of Staff Dave Goldfein may not have called Trump out directly , but his words are pointed at the president . 
1	143	 In his interview with the press , Goldfein did n't spare words of wisdom that Trump should better listen to . 
1	143	 Earlier this week , President Trump aka ‘ Orange Tyrant ' was at the MacDill Air Force Base to give his ridiculous and meaningless speeches . 
1	143	 Imagine what he told the military officers who left what they should be doing to listen to him if they do n't like him , he is not going to like them . 
1	143	 Barely a day after the president made this comment ; Goldfein apparently seemed to implicitly attack what the president said . 
1	143	" He said that "" This is a great opportunity to step back and remind ourselves and the American people of the oath we take as members of the military . "" "
1	143	 Goldfein said that the oath they too and they always retake every time they were promoted was to defend and support the American Constitution against any enemy both in the domestic and foreign arena . 
1	143	 By design , these military officers do not pledge to defend or support any leader or party because they are apolitical . 
1	143	 The military is not too friendly with the president according to Goldfein , one day ; the military may be protecting the people from Trump . 
1	143	 Goldfein indirectly criticized the disastrous raid in Yemen authorized by Trump , the assurance of Trump that the SEAL was going to have a field only pointed out that he was a local fish without the experience of swimming in the international waters . 
1	143	 One of the things that Goldfein is proud of is the fact that the military can not lose sight that they go to war with their values . 
1	143	 People who are critical of the efforts that the military undertakes each day to stop causalities are not aware of who the military are . 
1	143	 Indeed , Goldfein is a true patriot who defends the real values of American . 
1	143	 We are happy with the service that he is offering passionately to our country to ensure that our ideals are maintained . 
1	143	 It does n't look like the upper class of the military really like Trump .

1	144	"The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley ( R - IA ) is asking the FBI questions in what he describes as an "" alarming "" development about the debunked Trump dossier . "
1	144	" Senator Chuck Grassley sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray last week asking if there is a possibility that the contents of the dossier were "" surreptitiously funneled "" from foreign intelligence agencies to U.S. intelligence agencies essentially creating "" an echo "" of reporting information from the dossier . "
1	144	 Grassley pointed out that Christopher Steele , the British spy who compiled the garbage dossier acknowledged in a London court that he indeed shared the 35-page document with British intelligence agencies . 
1	144	 Per the Daily Caller : 
1	144	" "" It is possible that this political dossier 's collusion allegations … may have also been surreptitiously funneled into U.S. intelligence streams through foreign intelligence sharing , "" Grassley wrote in his letter to Wray . "
1	144	" "" If so , that foreign information would likely have ended up within the FBI 's investigation of allegations of collusion between Trump associates and Russia . "" "
1	144	 According to some reports , foreign intelligence agencies have shared information with U.S. investigators that matches some of the allegations about collusion laid out in the dossier . 
1	144	 But Trump and members of his campaign named in the dossier have denied the allegations . 
1	144	" Grassley also said , "" it may not have been clear to the FBI that the foreign reporting was actually based on the work of Mr. Steele and Fusion GPS . "
1	144	" If this in fact happened , it would be alarming . "" "
1	144	 As previously reported , a third deadline passed for the FBI and Justice Department to hand over subpoenaed documents to the House Intelligence Committee relating to the debunked Russian dossier on September 22nd . 
1	144	 The big question is , did the FBI actually use this garbage dossier to obtain a FISA warrant like reports suggest ? 
1	144	 The Obama FBI used a secret court order to wiretap Manafort . 
1	144	 We the people deserve to know if the debunked dossier was used to obtain this FISA warrant in order to spy on Trump 's camp . 
1	144	 What we do know is that Comey cited this dossier in some of his briefings : 
1	144	 FBI Director James Comey has cited the dossier in some of his briefings with lawmakers in recent weeks as one of the information sources used by his bureau to bolster its probe , U.S. officials briefed on the investigation told CNN . 
1	144	 We also know that Fusion GPS , the company that commissioned the dossier is a Democrat oppo research firm . 
1	144	 Via Paul Sperry of the New York Post : 
1	144	 A secretive Washington firm that commissioned the dubious intelligence dossier on Donald Trump is stonewalling congressional investigators trying to learn more about its connections to the Democratic Party . 
1	144	 Fusion GPS was on the payroll of an unidentified Democratic ally of Clinton when it hired a long - retired British spy to dig up dirt on Trump . 
1	144	 In 2012 , Democrats hired Fusion GPS to uncover dirt on GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney . 
1	144	 And in 2015 , Democrat ally Planned Parenthood retained Fusion GPS to investigate pro - life activists protesting the abortion group . 
1	144	 One of the most outrageous unconfirmed allegations in the report claims the Russians recorded Trump watching Russian prostitutes urinate on each other in a Moscow hotel room previously occupied by President and Mrs. Barack Obama . 
1	144	 And the liberal media and Secret Service and John McCain believed this nonsense ? 
1	144	 Now we learn Rep. Nunes has issued subpoenas to the firm behind the discredit dossier . 
1	144	 Zerohedge reports : 
1	144	 CNN reports that Nunes earlier this month issued subpoenas to the founders of Fusion GPS , the Washington opposition research firm that originally helped procure the dossier , demanding that they participate in public hearings before the House Intelligence Committee , and turn over all pertinent documents . 
1	144	 Earlier this year , Nunes announced that he was stepping aside from directing the committee 's Russia inquiry when he became the subject of an ethics investigation into his handling of classified information after he informed the White House about the possibility that members of the Trump campaign were legally surveilled during the race before informing his own committee . 
1	144	 [ … ] 
1	144	 Nunes ' Democratic colleagues have repeatedly accused Nunes of deliberately trying to undermine the FBI 's investigation by forcing the agency to reveal sensitive details about the dossier that the intelligence community previously decided to withhold from the January report on the intelligence community 's finding that Russia had interfered with the election . 
1	144	 Here is more background on the now - discredited Trump Dossier .

0	146	 AP Photo / Manuel Balce Ceneta ) 
0	146	 Following another dump of his personal emails , Hillary Clinton 's campaign chairman , John Podesta , is claiming that Russian hackers targeted his account to try and influence the presidential election -- and he suggested that those hackers tipped off a Trump advisor . 
0	146	 CBS News correspondent Nancy Cordes reports that Podesta on Tuesday went step - by - step through all the contact Donald Trump and his campaign aides have had with Russian actors or with Wikileaks . 
0	146	 He argued that it 's all circumstantial evidence pointing so some kind of secret understanding between Trump and the highest reaches of the Russian government . 
0	146	 Podesta said the theft of 10 years worth of emails from his gmail account is now being investigated as part of the FBI 's larger probe into hacks at the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) . 
0	146	" The U.S. intelligence community said on Friday that it is "" confident "" those hacks were directed by the "" Russian government . "" "
0	146	" "" Russian interference in this election and their apparent attempt to influence it on behalf of Mr. Trump is , I think , of -- should be of utmost concern to all Americans , "" Podesta told reporters from the Clinton campaign plane . "
0	146	" Podesta noted that long - time Trump confidant Roger Stone appeared to have advance notice of the hack , when Stone tweeted back in August : "" Trust me , it will soon be the Podesta 's time in the barrel . "" "
0	146	 Stone also recently told Florida Republicans that he was in touch with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange . 
0	146	 The emails are a revealing and sometimes embarrassing window into the workings of a major campaign . 
0	146	" In one , now - interim DNC chair Donna Brazile ( who was working for CNN ) appears to slip the campaign a "" question "" Clinton was to be asked at a CNN town hall during her primary contest against Bernie Sanders . "
0	146	" In another , Starbucks CEO and major Clinton donor Howard Schultz called the campaign "" stale "" and lacking the "" transparency that the American people ... will need to trust and ultimately elect "" Clinton . "
0	146	 Trump , for his part , has brushed off accusations that his words and his proposals seem to favor Putin . 
0	146	" "" She does n't know if it 's the Russians doing the hacking , "" Trump said during Sunday 's presidential debate town hall . "
0	146	" He also claimed "" I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia . "" "

0	146	" "" I frankly never thought I 'd see the day when we had a major party candidate who would be promoting those kinds of notions , "" the president said at a Clinton campaign event . "
0	146	 Podesta said he does n't know why Trump would be sympathetic to Russia , but he suggested that it might be his business dealings or his fascination with Vladimir Putin . 
0	146	 He added that he expects the leaks to soon follow the pattern of other Russian - led hacks , where they begin by releasing real documents at first -- and then start releasing fake ones .Clinton campaign does damage control after email hack
1	147	All in all , the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards was a pretty good Emmys .

1	147	 The audience laughed and cheered for this former face of the Donald Trump presidency , and then later in the night gave all the Emmys to The Handmaid 's Tale , you know , that show about how a dystopian , oppressive government is a bad thing . 
1	147	 Yay , cognitive dissonance ! 
1	147	 Anyways , I 'm not the only one who found this particular political stunt to be in fairly bad taste . 
1	147	 The reaction on Twitter to Sean Spicer 's Emmy appearance was overwhelmingly negative — from both regular viewers and celebrity viewers . 
1	147	" Former SNL player and actress Jenny Slate tweeted that she was "" so grossed out "" by the decision . "
1	147	 She said , 
1	147	 Truly so grossed out by A GROUP of people ever even considering the idea of real life Spicer at the Emmys . 
1	147	 What is wrong with you ? 
1	147	 Wake up . 
1	147	 Similarly , actor Zach Braff tweeted , 
1	147	" I 'm not ready to laugh "" with "" Sean Spicer . "
1	147	 I think he is an evil , opportunistic liar that hurt our country . 
1	147	 Filmmaker and actor Rob Reiner , known for his role as Max Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street , tweeted , 
1	147	 DT is a sick liar . 
1	147	 If we reward Sean Spicer for enabling his sickness , we are saying we accept a mentally ill POTUS . 
1	147	 And of course , though she did n't share her opinion on Twitter , Melissa McCarthy 's reaction when the camera cut to her during the real Spicer 's bit said a thousand words : She did not approve . 
1	147	 Many non - celebrities also shared their disapproval on Twitter , some viewer lamenting the double standard for 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and this small angry liar . 
1	147	 Others critiqued the Television Academy for its hypocrisy . 
1	147	 Again , though the night was filled anti - Trump sentiment , inspiring speeches about political activism , and supposedly subversive post - Trump television , Spicer was still invited onto that very same stage where that all took place . 
1	147	 And according to journalist Chris Gardner of The Hollywood Reporter , who attended the show , Spicer had no lack of fans and attention after the Emmys . 
1	147	 Gardner tweeted , 
1	147	 What pariah ? 
1	147	 Sean Spicer getting mobbed in # Emmys lobby . 
1	147	 Posing for pics , drinking beer , soaking up all attention after onstage appearance . 
1	147	 Do n't you just love it when lying politicians — who are so terrible at their job even Donald Trump has to fire them — become beloved , whacky celebrities ? 
1	147	 Thanks for that one , Academy of Television Arts & Sciences .Twitter Was Not Here For Sean Spicer 's Emmy Appearance
0	148	The 100 Funniest Tweets From the Unending Nightmare That 's Been the 2016 Election 
0	148	 Illustration by Shakeil Greeley for GQ / Getty Images 
0	148	 Laugh to stop yourself from crying . 
0	148	 There are only seven days left in the 2016 presidential . 
0	148	 Seven more days and , barring a last - minute constitutional crisis , this non - stop misery ride will finally be over . 
0	148	 How long has it been ? 
0	148	 Eight ? 
0	148	 Twelve ? 
0	148	 Thirteen years ? 
0	148	 No one really knows any more . 
0	148	 All we know is that the 2016 election has done to American democracy what cocaine did to Gary Busey 's career , and , much like being stuck in an elevator with Gary Busey , it 's hard not to pray for the sweet release of death . 
0	148	 A presidential candidate bragging about sexual assault , a presidential candidate threatening to put is political opponent in jail , dog - whistle racism , actual straight - up racism ; it 's fair to say we 're at a historic low - point in the story of American democracy . 
0	148	 If only President Obama could wipe the Internet clean before he leaves office , so we never have to be reminded of this god - awful mess ever again . 
0	148	 All that said , there was one bright light during these dark times : Twitter.com . 
0	148	 Previously home to die - hard One Direction fans and a few hundred - thousand accounts pretending to be Will Ferrell , Twitter was undoubtedly responsible for some of this election cycle 's most vile rhetoric — I mean , just look at Trump 's tweets . 
0	148	 But there 's no denying it also came into its own during the 2016 election . 
0	148	 It was n't fun watching Donald Trump routinely debase our country 's political system , but I 'm not going to pretend the well - crafted tweets that sparked into existence as a result were n't also a welcome catharsis . 
0	148	 To commemorate this bizarre time in our nation 's history , we 've compiled a chronological list of the 100 funniest * tweets of this genuinely terrible , and mostly unfunny , election . 
0	148	 Hopefully , if there 's anything left in the smoldering rubble that will be America after November 8th , they can be a reminder that there was at least some good in the parade of garbage . 
0	148	 Now let 's all agree to never ever do this ever again . 
0	148	 * According to us .

0	151	 Mrs Clinton had courted the so - called alien disclosure community for the past year after it emerged she and campaign manger John Podesta were keen to release any top - secret files held by the US Government about the subject of aliens and UFOs . 
0	151	 Their pledge was closely followed by the Paradigm Research Group , a campaign organisation set up by Steve Bassett , the only registered lobbyist on the UFO issue in the US . 
0	151	" Mr Bassett has been calling for an end to an alleged "" truth embargo "" that he and other UFO enthusiasts believe was put in place by global government to hide the truth about aliens visiting earth from the public since the infamous 1947 Roswell UFO incident in New Mexico . "
0	151	 But , now Mr Bassett is hoping Hillary Clinton and Mr Podesta can still influence incumbent President Barack Obama to disclose the files and reveal the truth before he leaves office in Janaury . 
0	151	" A statement on the PRG website says : "" There are 70 days left to persuade Secretary Clinton , John Podesta and President Obama to engage the media on the extraterrestrial issue leading to a White House / Pentagon rapprochement and Disclosure under President Obama . "" "
0	151	 In January , Mrs Clinton said she also wanted to open up on what is happening at the mysterious Area 51 military base in Nevada , where UFO conspiracists believe evidence of alien technology is hidden away . 
0	151	" Clinton claimed she would "" get to the bottom "" once and for all of questions and controversy over what the US Government does or does not know about the mysterious subject . "
0	151	" Responding to questions about UFOs from a reporter during an election interview in New Hampshire , she said : "" Yes , I am going to get to the bottom of it . "" "
0	151	 Clinton even admitted that she realises Earth may have actually been visited by extraterrestrials . 
0	151	 Clinton and husband former president Bill Clinton have allegedly tried to force disclosure of UFO files before , but even when the latter was in the White House it did not fully happen . 
0	151	" Bill Clinton met billionaire Laurance Rockefeller at his ranch in Wyoming in 1995 where they held discussions on the "" Rockefeller Initiative "" to secure release of all previously classified UFO files . "
0	151	 In 2007 , Mrs Clinton acknowledged that among the top freedom of information ( FOI ) requests her husband received as president were requests related to UFO and alien disclosure .

0	151	" She added in the new interview : "" I think we may have been visited already . "
0	151	" We do n't know for sure . "" "
0	151	 In 2014 her Mr Podesta said his biggest regret during his time as top adviser to President Obama was not securing release of classified UFO files . 
0	151	 Other alien hunters are now banking on President elect Donald Truth to unlock the files . 
0	151	" UFO blogger Scott C waring said : "" Will Trump reveal UFO info to the public , or will he skirt this issue ? ""Will truth over alien UFOs stay buried now Hillary Clinton failed to make the White House ?"
1	152	Usher 
1	152	 ILOSM family the situation between Usher and his STD accuser , Quantasia Sharpton , has just gotten even more real . 
1	152	 For Ms. Sharpton , it 's bad , but for Usher , it 's great . 
1	152	 As we previously informed you all , Quantasia claimed that she 'd met Usher at his concert and then had a one night stand with him later that night , without him telling her that he allegedly has herpes … 
1	152	 Fans Called Accuser 's Bluff 
1	152	 It was her details ( and the prior lies she was accused of telling about other celebs ) that caused many Usher fans to call her bluff though . 
1	152	 Sharpton claimed that after Usher 's concert , she went back to her Days Inn hotel room and Usher called her , then went to Days Inn to sex her up like Color Me Badd ( okay she did n't say the Color Me Badd part , but if the shoe fits … ) . 
1	152	 Anywho , after fans heard her ‘ Days Inn ' claim , they were like ‘ Chile please … Usher ai n't rollin ' up to a cheap Days Inn hotel room to have sex with you . ' 
1	152	 Attorney Lisa Bloom with her client / Usher accuser , Quantasia Days Inn Employee 's Claims 
1	152	 Days later , an alleged Days Inn worker then claimed she saw Usher walk into the hotel to go see Quantasia . 
1	152	" The worker also said the only reason she revealed that is because she did n't like that Usher reportedly said to the press that Quantasia is n't "" his type . "" "
1	152	 Many Usher fans did n't buy the employee 's story either . 
1	152	 Usher 's Team Provides Their Proof 
1	152	 Fast forward to today and Usher has spoken , through his team , to provide 3 facts that shoot down Quantasia 's claims , according to TMZ . 
1	152	 Check out what was reported by Usher 's people below … 
1	152	 1 . 
1	152	 WIFE / MANAGER : 
1	152	 Usher and wife / manager , Grace Miguel 
1	152	 Sources close to the singer tell TMZ … he says there was never a hotel hookup with Quantasia Sharpton , telling friends , in November 2014 he was on the verge of getting engaged to Grace Miguel . 
1	152	 Usher tells them at the time of his alleged encounter , Grace was his manager and they spent ALL their free time together . 
1	152	 His people say when the two were n't enjoying free time , it was all business , and they were inseparable . 
1	152	 The couple got engaged less than 2 months after the alleged Days Inn tryst .- via TMZ 
1	152	 2 . 
1	152	 ACCUSER 'S TIMELINE CONFLICT : 
1	152	 Usher 's people also say on the night in question his show ran late , which pushed the meet - and - greet well after midnight … and that flies in the face with Quantasia 's timeline in which she claims she hooked up with the singer around 12 . 
1	152	 -via TMZ 
1	152	 3 . 
1	152	 TRAVEL SCHEDULE CONFLICT : 
1	152	 We 're told his travel schedule was super tight too … making it even more unlikely he even had time to step out for a secret trip to the Days Inn . 
1	152	 -via TMZ 
1	152	 Sometimes it 's best to make moves in silence … I wonder if Quantasia Sharpton and her attorney , Lisa Bloom , are now wishing that she did , because this is turning out to be a mess .

1	153	" Earlier this week , CNN published a story titled "" White supremacists by default ' : How ordinary people made Charlottesville possible , "" which basically said that every single person that voted for Donald Trump to be president was a White Supremacist by Default . "
1	153	 John Blake , CNN Enterprise writer / producer , is the article 's author . 
1	153	 Blake blamed Trump voters for helping to advance white supremacy . 
1	153	 How , you may ask ? 
1	153	 Because even the ordinary , non - racist Trump supporter was giving space for white supremacists to operate and are ultimately the reason for what took place in Charlottesville , Virginia . 
1	153	" "" It 's easy to focus on the angry white men in paramilitary gear who looked like they were mobilizing for a race war in the Virginia college town , "" Blake wrote . "" "
1	153	" But it 's the ordinary people — the voters who elected a reality TV star with a record of making racially insensitive comments , the people who move out of the neighborhood when people of color move in , the family members who ignore a relative 's anti - Semitism — who give these type of men room to operate . "" "
1	153	 Now , Blake is a Black man . 
1	153	 Given the fact he is writing at CNN , would it be safe to assume he supported Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Soebarkah ? 
1	153	 If so , would it also , given the fact of his warped logic here , be fair to use his logic against him and say that he is responsible for the violence of the knockout game , Black Lives Matter and the advancement of Black Power movements like the New Black Panthers and Louis Farrakhan 's Nation of Islam ? 
1	153	 Bathroom Issues ? 
1	153	 Do This Once A Day 
1	153	 Yeah , it makes a point , but it would n't be fair to say , would it ? 
1	153	 Blake was not alone in putting this piece together . 
1	153	" He cited Mark Naison , a political activist and history professor at Fordham University in New York City , who compared Trump supporters to the "" nice people "" in Nazi Germany and Rwanda . "
1	153	" "" That was the twisted formula that made the Holocaust and Rwanda possible and allowed Jim Crow segregation to survive : Nice people looked the other way while those with an appetite for violence did the dirty work , "" Naison said . "" "
1	153	 You have to have millions of people who are willing to be bystanders , who push aside evidence of racism , Islamophobia or sexism . 
1	153	" You ca n't have one without the other . "" "
1	153	 Blake then went on to say that there are four groups of people who play a part in racial divisions in the country , based on Ms. Naison and others . 
1	153	" "" Many of the white racists who marched in Charlottesville were condemned because they openly said they do n't believe in integration or racial equality , "" Blake wrote about Trump supporters . "" "
1	153	 But millions of ordinary white Americans have been sending that message to black and brown people for at least a half a century . 
1	153	" They send it with their actions : They do n't want to live next to or send their children to school with black or brown people , historians say . "" "
1	153	 Then there are those who thought Trump 's comments about both sides having issues when it comes to racial hatred . 
1	153	" "" Trump 's ‘ many sides ' response , though , was n't that abnormal in the context of US history , "" wrote Blake . "" "
1	153	 It used to be the norm for white political leaders to draw a moral equivalence between racists and those who suffered from their acts of brutality , historians say . 
1	153	" It 's the "" yes , but "" rhetorical maneuver — condemn racism but add a qualifier to diminish the sincerity of what you just said . "" "
1	153	 Trump 's comments were spot on for anyone paying attention . 
1	153	 Obama had stirred up racial tensions in America to the point that even Black people were saying he was doing it . 
1	153	 Then Blake decided to list a third group . 
1	153	" This group is those who "" choose chaos . "" "
1	153	" "" Many voters knew Trump would bring something else to the Oval Office — chaos , "" Blake wrote . "" "
1	153	 That 's why they chose him . 
1	153	" He 's their first reality TV president , one writer says . "" "
1	153	" "" Many voted for Trump because they liked the persona he cultivated as the star of ‘ The Apprentice , ' "" he continued . "" "
1	153	" Reality TV rewards characters who say rude and reprehensible things , characters are often cast as racial stereotypes , and those who provoke the most chaos get the most attention , says Joy Lanzendorfer , author of the Vice article , ‘ How Reality TV Made Donald Trump President . ' "" "
1	153	 Again , he never mentions the chaos we saw across the country that was sparked by the Black Lives Matter crowds . 
1	153	 To do that would demonstrate the hypocrisy of his article . 
1	153	" Finally , there are those that Blake says "" look the other way . "" "
1	153	" "" If you want to know why those white racists now feel so emboldened , it may help to look at all the ordinary people around you , your neighbors , your family members , your leaders , "" Blake wrote . "" "
1	153	" But first , start by looking at yourself . "" "
1	153	 Well , turn about is fair play . 
1	153	 Perhaps , Mr. Blake should look in the mirror and then take a look at the lying , manipulative and deceitful propaganda outlet he is working for , then maybe , he might get a clue at just how badly he has been indoctrinated before he points the finger at people who have light skin and labels them all racist because of some delusional logic that he possesses . 
1	153	 Mr. Blake might also wonder how he is emboldening the racism of those in his own community .

0	154	Turns Out The Uxbridge Fresh Prince Of Bad Hair Is 19 , Still In High School , And Put Uxbridge High On Lockdown After A Gun Incident On Snapchat 
0	154	 Want to advertise with Turtleboy ? 
0	154	 Email us at Turtleboysports@gmail.com for more information . 
0	154	 Earlier today we blogged about the Uxbridge Fresh Prince of Bad Hair , who thought it would be wise to shoot a cop car with a BB gun , and then shoot an autistic man the next day . 
0	154	 We could n't find his Facebook page , but within an hour we had a million people pointing us to his Uxbridge street name - Tre Patterson : 
0	154	 As you can see , we 're dealing with a real winner here . 
0	154	 Turns out this 19 year old is STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL ! ! 
0	154	 I shit you not . 
0	154	 That 's why the two others he was with are n't having their names released - because they 're his minor friends from high school . 
0	154	" He tells kids in his peer group what things were like "" back in my day . "" "
0	154	" This year Tre , who recently moved here from "" down south , "" and claims to have enrolled at Uxbridge High School because the coach at UConn told him it would help him get recruited , was suspended multiple times . "
0	154	 One of the incidents happened when he got the school put on lock down because he had beef with kids from another school on snapchat , and he claimed he had a gun on snapchat , DURING SCHOOL HOURS , and the other kids were coming to UHS with more guns . 
0	154	 After being uncooperative with the principals AND the cops about it , he was escorted off the premises and suspended . 
0	154	 Not expelled- just suspended . 
0	154	 Because I 'm sure when he came back he had a newfound thirst for knowledge and a desire to follow school rules . 
0	154	 He also was on the basketball and football teams , but hardly ever played because his grades were n't good enough . 
0	154	 It 's hard passing college prep math when you 're only 19 years old . 
0	154	 So much for UConn . 
0	154	 Here he is all dolled up for the first of many junior proms to come for Tre - Tre : 
0	154	 Of course he 's the cool kid because he can legally buy booze in Canada and no one else can : 
0	154	 Do n't worry though , the fam is holding it down on Facebook and has gone full free my boi ! 
0	154	" Apparently his response to the cops after he shot the autistic man was that he "" did n't know he had autism . "" "
0	154	 Because it 's OK to shoot people with BB guns in public as long as they 're not autistic . 
0	154	 Oh , and autistic people all have tattoos on their forehead that let them know they 're autistic . 
0	154	 That 's literally the though process of this nudnik . 
0	154	 Anyway , this is yet another example of the failed educational policies from our state and federal government . 
0	154	 This is what happens when administrators value their graduation rates more than the well - being of the entire school - they keep shitheads like this in school instead of expelling them . 
0	154	 Because it looks better on a chart if they have less dropouts . 
0	154	 Oh , and do n't forget that schools all have mandates from the federal government , due to Arne Duncan 's reign of terror , to reduce suspension rates , particularly for students of color . 
0	154	 So now schools like Uxbridge are forced to keep morons like this , who obviously have no intention of learning , enrolled in schools . 
0	154	 They make it impossible for teachers to do their job and they poison the rest of the student body with their bullshit . 
0	154	 Uxbridge High School lost an entire day of learning because of him . 
0	154	 If somehow he graduates this year he 'll be 20 when he does so . 
0	154	 And it will only be the result of social promotion , fueled by a desire for better charts . 
0	154	 We urge you to support the following local businesses .Turns Out The Uxbridge Fresh Prince Of Bad Hair Is 19 , Still In High School , And Put Uxbridge High On Lockdown After A Gun Incident On Snapchat

0	155	" "" I 've made a lot of sacrifices , "" Trump said . "" "
0	155	 I work very , very hard .

1	157	 The most self - confident man or woman knows that it does n't take much skill to walk up behind them , point a gun to the back of their head , and pull the trigger .  
1	157	 This week , a Minneapolis mayoral candidate is running on major police reform that involves disarming the city 's police force . 
1	157	 Raymond Dehn revealed the radical approach to public safety he 'll be taking should he be elected mayor in an interview with Fox 9 Minneapolis less than two weeks following the death of an Australian national by the name of Justine Damond . 
1	157	 Damond , of course , was the woman shot and killed by Officer Mohamed Noor on July 15 while attempting to report the sound of a woman screaming behind her house . 
1	157	" No one will ever know for sure whether it was the fireworks taking place in the area that night or if it was the alleged "" slapping "" of the patrol car by the victim just before the shooting that caused it . "
1	157	 The only absolute in this tragic situation is that Justine Damond — a woman who called the police for help — is dead from a bullet shot from an officer 's gun . 
1	157	 As is the case with every high - profile ( Officer Involved Shooting ) OIS , the equation can not be balanced by departmental explanations that offer no objective truth in the minds of the masses . 
1	157	 People are angry . 
1	157	 They do n't want explanations . 
1	157	 They want action . 
1	157	 Dehn , of course , knows this and is attempting to capitalize on it at the polls by painting police with a broad brush as incompetent and unnecessarily armed . 
1	157	 Do n't miss the fact that the District 59B representative only wants MPD officers to be restricted from carrying firearms on their hips . 
1	157	 If he had it his way , he 'd still allow them to keep guns in their vehicles . 
1	157	" Therefore , his "" solution "" does n't even attempt to prevent the Justine Damond death from occurring . "
1	157	 It 's an empty proposal made at an opportune time . 
1	157	 There 's a reason the Justine Damond story has become an international story . 
1	157	 It is a statistical anomaly . 
1	157	 According to the Washington Post OIS Database , of the 574 civilians killed in officer - involved shootings so far this year , Damond is one of five unarmed women . 
1	157	 The other four casualties on this list are Sariah Marie Lane , Ambroshia Fagre , Elena Mondragon , and Alteria Woods . 
1	157	 No compatible source was found for this video . 
1	157	 Lane , Fagre , and Mondragon were all killed while riding as passengers of fleeing vehicles that had been suspected by police to be stolen , involved in burglaries , and/or armed robberies . 
1	157	 All four vehicles were used as deadly weapons by their drivers as they rammed police in attempts to get away . 
1	157	 Woods , on the other hand , was used as a human shield by her boyfriend during a SWAT raid targeting him and his father for multiple shootings . 
1	157	 While these four women were killed during deadly force encounters in which they were accessories to crimes committed by boyfriends , Damond 's case is entirely unique . 
1	157	 The trend continues if we go back a few years . 
1	157	 In 2016 , three unarmed women were killed by police . 
1	157	 Jessica Williams was shot in San Francisco after nearly trapping one officer between a fence and the stolen vehicle she was attempting to flee in . 
1	157	 Kelsey Hauser was killed riding as a passenger in a stolen vehicle when her boyfriend attempted to run over officers after leading them on a high - speed pursuit in California . 
1	157	 The third was 12-year - old Ciara Meyer , who was struck and killed after a constable 's bullet passed through her father 's arm . 
1	157	 Meyer 's father reportedly pointed a rifle at the chest of one constable as he served an eviction order at the apartment . 
1	157	 Meyer was set to lose his apartment . 
1	157	 Instead , he got his daughter killed . 
1	157	 In 2015 , three unarmed women were shot and killed by police . 
1	157	 India Kager was killed in Virginia while driving a vehicle with a homicide suspect in the passenger seat . 
1	157	 When police approached the vehicle in a convenience store parking lot , Kager 's passenger opened fire on police . 
1	157	 Both were killed in the shootout . 
1	157	 The second was a 55-year old woman named Bettie Jones during a domestic violence call in Chicago . 
1	157	 As an officer opened fire on a bat - wielding man in the apartment , Jones was caught in the cross - fire . 
1	157	 The third , Autumn Steele , was shot by an officer responding to a domestic violence call in Iowa . 
1	157	 Steele and her husband were actively fighting upon the officer 's arrival . 
1	157	 After being bitten by the family dog , the officer fell backward while opening fire on the animal . 
1	157	 Two rounds hit Steele instead . 
1	157	" Each of the eleven officer - involved shootings involving "" unarmed "" females in the past three years is tragic — but the trend shows that seven of them were killed while engaging in criminal activity with boyfriends with a penchant for violence . "
1	157	 Bettie Jones , Ciara Meyer , and Autumn Steel were killed as bystanders in legitimate deadly force encounters where officers feared for their lives . 
1	157	 That leaves Justine Damond in a class of her own . 
1	157	 Like I said , her death is the anomaly of all anomalies . 
1	157	 Politicians like Raymond Dehn are free to use their own history of criminality to bolster their political profile in a society that loves a comeback story . 
1	157	 Being a recovering cocaine addict and felon does n't preclude anyone from running for mayor , but when a politician takes advantage of tragedies such as Justine Damond 's death to suggest that police officers should place themselves in imminent danger … well , that 's where the line needs to be drawn . 
1	157	 Despite advances in proficiency for firearms training over the course of several decades , 27 police officers have already been murdered by gunfire in the line of duty this year . 
1	157	 In 2015 , the total was 47 . 
1	157	 In 2016 , it was 63 . 
1	157	 According to the Officer Down Memorial Page , we are currently on track to lose around the same number to gunfire this year . 
1	157	 Hopefully , we 'll buck the trend . 
1	157	 Every officer will tell you that there is a wide spectrum of skill levels as it relates to weapons tactics , handling , and marksmanship . 
1	157	 What we 'll also all tell you is that the level of skill a cop possesses matters little if someone is hellbent on killing them . 
1	157	 An easy response for anyone telling you Dehn is onto something is to tell them that many of the gunfire - related deaths American police get hit with each year are ambushes . 
1	157	 The most self - confident man or woman knows that it does n't take much skill to walk up behind them , point a gun to the back of their head , and pull the trigger .

1	158	"Hillary Clinton called Monica Lewinsky a "" narcissistic loony tune . "" "
1	158	" She called Gennifer Flowers "" some failed cabaret singer . "" "
1	158	" She said Republicans in Congress had organized "" a vast right - wing conspiracy "" against her husband , President Bill Clinton . "
1	158	" And now the former secretary of state and defeated Democratic presidential candidate says those of us still interested in the investigating of her conduct are engaging in an "" abuse of power . "" "
1	158	 Hillary Clinton expects special treatment . 
1	158	 She always has . 
1	158	 The real question is : why did the FBI give it to her ? 
1	158	" The FBI 's investigation of Hillary Clinton was referred to as "" special "" in an email sent by current FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe . "
1	158	 He was the assistant director in charge of the FBI 's Washington Field Office before his promotion to the second - ranking spot in the bureau . 
1	158	 Despite a deep web of connections to Clinton , McCabe formally recused himself from the email investigation only a week before the 2016 election . 
1	158	 McCabe 's admissions are telling , but not inaccurate . 
1	158	 Four months have passed since 20 members of the House Judiciary Committee demanded a special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton . 
1	158	 No action from the Department of Justice has been taken . 
1	158	 Only a special person could have her spouse meet with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on a tarmac in Phoenix during an ongoing criminal investigation . 
1	158	 Recently released emails show that Bill Clinton purposely altered his departure to get time alone with Lynch . 
1	158	 While the FBI was very concerned with punishing the agent who disclosed the Lynch - Bill Clinton meeting , the impropriety of the gathering garnered far less attention . 
1	158	" When Lynch told then - FBI Director James Comey to refer to the Hillary Clinton investigation as a "" matter "" rather than an "" investigation , "" language had a special meaning . "
1	158	" According to McCabe , "" the decision was made to investigate ( Hillary Clinton ) at HQ with a small team . "" "
1	158	 The double standard is glaring . 
1	158	 More prosecutors are currently investigating President Trump than were assigned to the Oklahoma City bombing , but Hillary Clinton got the small team at HQ . 
1	158	" And how did the "" small team at HQ "" handle the investigation ? "
1	158	 In a word - special . 
1	158	 Somewhere between the first and the final draft , Comey 's statement changed . 
1	158	" He first wrote that Hillary Clinton 's use of a private email server was "" grossly negligent . "" "
1	158	" The final draft said she was "" extremely careless . "" "
1	158	 Comey 's exoneration was drafted before the FBI interviewed key witnesses - including Clinton herself . 
1	158	" When Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough confronted officials about the depth of Clinton 's crimes , he faced threats and "" personal blowback "" against him and his family . "
1	158	 McCullough 's reports were delivered to then - Director of National Intelligence James Clapper . 
1	158	" Clapper spoke of the "" heartburn "" that exposure would create for Hillary Clinton 's campaign . "
1	158	 In every instance , being special has redounded to Hillary Clinton 's political and legal benefit . 
1	158	 Not so for President Trump . 
1	158	 Some at the Department of Justice and the FBI seem to have a special bias against the president . 
1	158	 FBI Agent Peter Strzok sent biased anti - Trump text messages . 
1	158	 He worked on both the Clinton email scandal and the Mueller probe . 
1	158	 It remains unclear what evidence he reviewed , generated or damaged in either investigation . 
1	158	 Four months have passed since 20 members of the House Judiciary Committee demanded a special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton . 
1	158	 No action from the Department of Justice has been taken . 
1	158	 As members of the Judiciary Committee , we have demanded an investigation into the FBI 's procedures , practices , oversight and reporting . 
1	158	 If biased agents have tainted evidence , we need to see it . 
1	158	 If politically - interested prosecutors have an agenda , we need to know it . 
1	158	 If our government institutions are being undermined by the deep state , we must expose it . 
1	158	 After all , equal treatment under the law is just one thing that makes America so special .

1	159	I am writing this article for an audience consisting of all the good people who , like myself , sincerely want a more equal and democratic society and who ( unlike myself ) , to achieve this goal , look for leadership from the prominent individuals and organizations that seem to share this goal . 
1	159	" Most of these leaders are commonly identified either as "" of the Left "" or "" progressive "" or "" liberal "" or "" Marxist . "" "
1	159	" In this article I will refer to all of these prominent leaders as "" the Left . "" "
1	159	 According to the standard wisdom , the Left is providing good leadership to achieve a more equal and democratic society and the problem is that not enough people follow this leadership , and so the enemies of the Left ( led by what I call the ruling class ) remain in power . 
1	159	 The problem , in this mistaken view , is that the Left is weak . 
1	159	 What I will show is that , on the contrary , the problem ( for those who want a more equal and democratic society , that is ) is that the Left is wrong . 
1	159	 What do I mean ? 
1	159	 The Left is wrong in its fundamental view of ordinary people , and because of this wrong view the ruling class is able to use the Left to divide and rule good people . 
1	159	 So let 's start by seeing what 's wrong with the Left 's view of ordinary people . 
1	159	 The Left 's Wrong View of Ordinary People 
1	159	 Before discussing the Left 's wrong view it helps to say what the truth is about ordinary people . 
1	159	 The truth is that the vast majority of ordinary people ( in the world , and in the United States as well ) want society to be based on the positive values of concern for one another ( as opposed to dog - eat - dog competition ) , mutual aid ( as opposed to some people taking unfair advantage of others ) and equality ( in the sense of having no rich and no poor and in the sense of ordinary people rather than a privileged and self - serving elite having the real say in social decisions . ) 
1	159	 This is why ordinary people are the solution , not the problem , today . 
1	159	 The Left disagrees . 
1	159	 The Left views the majority of ordinary people as the problem , not the solution , because their supposed values are the problem : selfishness and greed , racism , sexism , homophobia , transphobia , and the list grows all the time . 
1	159	 The Left believes that certain subsets of ordinary people ( people of color , non - heterosexuals , transgender people , etc . ) 
1	159	 are oppressed by the ordinary people who are different . 
1	159	 The solution , in this Leftist view , is to persuade the oppressive ordinary people to change their ugly ways and values . 
1	159	 The Marxist Left ( which I have written about here ) sometimes adds to the above an emphasis , more than the liberal / progressive leftists , on the issue of class : the material oppression of the working class by the capitalist class . 
1	159	 The Marxist Left thus , sharing the liberal / progressive left 's negative view of the deplorable values of ordinary people , points out that despite their terrible values working class people nonetheless have a class interest in opposing the ruling class . 
1	159	" The solution according to the Marxist Left is , again , to persuade ordinary people to change their ugly ways and values ( or , as the Marxists would say , to "" become class conscious . "" ) "
1	159	 The idea that the values of the vast majority of ordinary people are the solution , not the problem -- that they are the values that ought to shape society and are the opposite of the terrible values of the ruling class -- is the truthful idea that will enable good people to succeed in building a huge popular movement to make society genuinely equal and democratic . ( 
1	159	 A wonderful entire book about this is online here . ) 
1	159	 But hardly anybody knows how true this idea is , thanks to the ruling class propaganda against it and also thanks to the Left 's rejection of it . 
1	159	 Perhaps you , dear reader , think this idea is false . 
1	159	" If so , please read ( here ) about my experience at a pro - Trump rally asking random people there if they thought it was a good idea or a bad idea to "" remove the rich from power to have real , not fake , democracy with no rich and no poor . "" "
1	159	 86 % of them ( 43 out of the 50 I asked ) thought it was a good ( or great ! ) 
1	159	 idea and those 43 people all gladly took my button with that message and many pinned it onto themselves right on the spot . 
1	159	 Consider this please . 
1	159	 If ordinary people were as selfish and vile as the Left claims , then our world would be infinitely more horrible than it actually is , with everybody stabbing each other in the back and nobody giving a damn about anybody else . 
1	159	 This is the kind of world that it would be -- a veritable hellish nightmare of a world -- if the disgusting selfish competitive values of the ruling class were also those of everybody else . 
1	159	 The fact that our world is not this hellish nightmare , but one in which most people cooperate and help each other and respect one another as equals in countless ways that we take so much for granted that we do n't think about them or even notice them , this fact has huge significance : it shows that most ordinary people are the positive force in the world , a force that challenges capitalist values and that ought to shape all of society . 
1	159	 How the Ruling Class USES the Left to Divide and Rule Us 
1	159	 I have written a whole book(Divide and Rule ) about how the ruling class uses the Left to divide and rule us . 
1	159	 What follows is a brief summary with some links to some of my online articles treating particular issues in more detail . 
1	159	 Here 's how the ruling class uses the Left for divide - and - rule . 
1	159	" The ruling class takes ( or invents ) a "" hot button "" ( i.e. , potentially very divisive social issue ) and , with its control of the mainstream ( and alternative ! ) "
1	159	 media , it imposes a very particular framework on the public debate about the issue . 
1	159	 The framework is designed to be maximally divisive . 
1	159	" The framework is made maximally divisive by defining two opposing views ( I call them "" camps "" ) in a way that ensures that the people in each camp -- when they hear about the opposing camp -- will view the members of the opposing camp with utter contempt and possibly fear . "
1	159	 The ruling class does this by a ) providing each camp 's position with arguments designed to be maximally offensive to the other camp , and b ) censoring facts that , if known , would cause people in the opposing camps to see that they had far more agreement with each other than they otherwise would realize , and that the concerns of the opposing camp were quite reasonable ( instead of deplorable ) even if they still disagreed . 
1	159	 Here are some examples of how the ruling class uses the Left to make this work . 
1	159	 How To Easily Kill 98 % Of Mold In Your Home 
1	159	 Race 
1	159	" The truth is that a ) the ruling class for centuries has systematically discriminated against people not of European descent ( "" whites "" ) and b ) the ruling class did this in order to more effectively dominate , control and oppress working class people of ALL races . "
1	159	 The early British big property owners in the Virginia Colony instituted slavery based on race because they feared that otherwise there would be more rebellions of the working class ( laborers in the tobacco plantations of both African and European descent ) united regardless of race , as happened in Bacon 's Rebellion in 1676 - -a rebellion that almost overthrew the British ruling elite . ( 
1	159	 Read more about this here . ) 
1	159	 The truth is that when the ruling class singles out some working class people for harsher treatment than others , it is for the purpose of creating mutual mistrust , resentment and fear between those singled out for special discrimination and the others . 
1	159	 Thus the racist Jim Crow laws in the South not only harmed blacks ; they also harmed the poor whites , whose wages were lower than white wages in the North because Jim Crow prevented them from having strong ( i.e. , integrated ) unions and diverted their anger at blacks instead of the wealthy whites who oppressed them . 
1	159	 The truth is that , among working class people , AN INJURY TO ONE IS AN INJURY TO ALL . 
1	159	 But the Left disagrees . 
1	159	 The Left asserts exactly what the ruling class also asserts : that racial discrimination against non - whites benefits white working class people . 
1	159	" The ruling class asserted that slavery and Jim Crow benefited poor whites and the Left chimes right in by asserting that white working class people enjoy "" white privilege "" ( the word "" privilege "" means , by definition , a benefit ) . "
1	159	 The Left never says that racial discrimination against non - whites also HARMS white working class people . 
1	159	" The ruling class promotes ( with its foundations ) the use of "" white privilege "" rhetoric ( as I show in great detail here ) and counts on the Left not explaining ( as I do here ) that "" white privilege "" is a phrase designed to hide the truth that AN INJURY TO ONE IS AN INJURY TO ALL . "
1	159	" On the contrary , the Left is largely responsible for the sad fact that young people today use the horribly misleading phrase "" white privilege "" to refer to what the Martin Luther King , Jr. Civil Rights Movement referred to with the very good phrase "" racial discrimination . "" "
1	159	 The result is that working class people are being effectively divided and ruled along race lines , as I discuss here . 
1	159	 Earlier , the ruling class promoted Affirmative Action to divide and rule us along race lines , as I discuss in more detail here . ( 
1	159	 Please read this short linked article if you believe that Affirmative Action was truly about helping non - white minority people . 
1	159	 It was not ! ) 
1	159	 Affirmative Action was the flip side of the coin of the New Jim Crow of racist prison incarceration ; both were launched in the 1970s by the same ruling class . 
1	159	" The New Jim Crow of racist prison incarceration was designed to make whites fear blacks and Hispanics as "" a criminal race "" ; Affirmative Action was designed to make white working class people fear blacks and Hispanics as job - stealers , by making sure that whites applying for a job or school admission would be told essentially , "" We 're sorry , we could n't give you the position you applied for because we had to give it to a less qualified minority person . "" "
1	159	 Did the Left expose Affirmative Action for the divisive strategy it was ? 
1	159	 Did the Left fight for the kind of reforms that would truly remedy the harm of past racial discrimination and also gain large white working class support ( as my above linked article discusses ) ? 
1	159	 No ! 
1	159	 the Left accused white working class people who very understandably objected to the new government - mandated racial discrimination of being racists . 
1	159	 The ruling class thus used the Left to ensure that its divide and rule strategy would be maximally effective . 
1	159	 Feminism 
1	159	 In the 1970s the ruling class hijacked the traditional feminist movement ( that strove for equality of men and women under the law and in the workplace ) and replaced its leadership with a new breed of radical feminists who asserted that our society was one in which men -- all men , by virtue of being male -- were the oppressor class oppressing all women ; that men , in other words , were the enemy -- the patriarchy . 
1	159	" The ruling class defined "" being a progressive feminist "" as subscribing to this "" men are the enemy "" belief . "
1	159	 It was pure divide - and - rule . 
1	159	 I discuss this at some length in my article here . 
1	159	" The Left completely agreed with the ruling class 's "" men are the enemy "" theme and accused those who disagreed of being sexist . "
1	159	 Just as with racial discrimination , there is real discrimination against women , but it harms working class men as well because , as discussed above , AN INJURY TO ONE IS AN INJURY TO ALL . 
1	159	 The Left , however , never explained this and in fact rejected it . 
1	159	 The result , thanks in large part to the Left , is that ordinary people feel that their only choice here is either to a ) agree that all men are the enemy or else b ) dismiss any effort to end discrimination against women as an attack on men . 
1	159	 Same - sex Marriage 
1	159	 Believe it or not , there is a position on same - sex marriage that would be agreeable to most people in the pro- same - sex marriage camp and ALSO to most people in the anti - same - sex marriage camp . 
1	159	 I write about this position here ; it 's a position that addresses the actual concerns of both camps . 
1	159	 You 've most likely never heard of this position because the ruling class did n't want it to be known ; the ruling class wanted each camp on this issue to view the other as despicable . 
1	159	 The Left went right along with the ruling class in this regard , leading in the campaign to demonize anybody opposed to same - sex marriage as a despicable bigot or idiotic Bible fundamentalist . 
1	159	 The divisiveness on this issue is so thorough that many people can not even imagine joining with people in the opposing camp to fight together for anything , such as making our society more equal and democratic . 
1	159	 Thanks largely to the Left . 
1	159	 Abortion 
1	159	 As I discuss in some detail here , the ruling class has cleverly , and dishonestly , framed the abortion issue as one in which one side is against murder and wants women to suffer , and the other side does n't want women to suffer and has no problem with murder whatsoever . 
1	159	 Again , as with same - sex marriage , there is a position on abortion ( discussed in my linked article above ) that would gain the respect of most people in both the pro- and anti - abortion camps . 
1	159	 But the ruling class censors this position , and the Left helps to censor it . 
1	159	 The Left simply accuses people opposed to abortion of being deplorable . 
1	159	 This is exactly what the ruling class counts on to make its divide - and - rule strategy work . 
1	159	 Muslim Refugees 
1	159	" Key Fact : The ruling class , as I discuss in detail here , makes sure that there are domestic acts ( or almost acts ) of "" Muslim "" terrorism so that many Americans will be terrified of Muslims . "
1	159	 The ruling class then promotes a great debate about whether to allow or not allow Muslim refugees to enter the country . 
1	159	 The camp in favor of not allowing them in accuses the opposing camp of being , at best , suicidal idiots . 
1	159	 The camp in favor of allowing the refugees in ( which the Left is a prominent part of ) accuses the opposing camp of being inhumane racists . 
1	159	 The Left is silent about the Key Fact . 
1	159	 This makes the divide - and - rule work perfectly . 
1	159	 Immigration 
1	159	 Key Fact : The ruling class for a long time has been forcing large numbers ordinary people in Mexico and Central America to migrate to the United States illegally , as I discuss here and here . 
1	159	 Because most people do not understand this key fact , the ruling class is able to orchestrate a big and extremely divisive debate about whether the illegal immigrants should be allowed to remain or not ( not about whether the ruling class that forced them to come to the U.S. illegally should be removed from power , mind you , a position that would unite most of the people in both camps , not to mention the illegal migrants themselves ! ) 
1	159	 Does the Left tell people about the Key Fact ? 
1	159	 No . 
1	159	 It just accuses the people who want to deport the illegal aliens of being deplorable racists . 
1	159	 While the ruling class and its right - wing radio talk show hosts exaggerate the harm to American citizens caused by the massive illegal immigration , there are in fact ways that this massive influx of people either directly causes -- or is used as a pretext by the ruling class to cause -- harm to working class American citizens . 
1	159	 The Left ignores this fact ( also discussed in my linked article above ) and simply accuses anybody who supports deporting illegal immigrants of being motivated by racism or selfishness . 
1	159	 This is exactly what the ruling class needs to make its divide - and - rule strategy work .

1	159	 Transgender Bathrooms 
1	159	 Key Fact : In most states ( including North Carolina with its infamous HB2 law ) , a person can have the gender on their birth certificate changed simply by providing documentation that they had sex - change surgery . 
1	159	 As I discuss in some detail here , the transgender bathroom issue is phony from the git - go . 
1	159	 The status quo ( prior to this becoming a big issue ) regarding bathroom use was not oppressive to , or even viewed as oppressive by , transgender people . 
1	159	 The supposedly bigoted North Carolina HB2 law is not oppressive to transgender people because of the Key Fact . 
1	159	 But NPR ( etc . ) 
1	159	 censored the Key Fact so that its liberal audience , hearing about the HB2 law and being told that it was oppressive , would believe this lie , and view those who opposed the new liberal bathroom legislation ( which truly IS oppressive ) as bigots . 
1	159	 The Left , as to be expected , eagerly accuses people of being transphobic bigots if they think that a woman in a public access shower room should be able to tell a person entering that room who has male genitalia to leave . ( 
1	159	 The new liberal laws are based on exactly this absurd notion ! ) 
1	159	 What more could the ruling class ask from the Left than to accuse perfectly good and decent people with a perfectly common - sense opinion of being bigots ? 
1	159	 Israel 
1	159	" The ruling class - imposed framework for debating U.S. support for Israel is this : "" One camp is not anti - Semitic and therefore supports Israel , and the opposing camp is anti - Semitic and therefore does not support Israel . "" "
1	159	" I have written in detail here(including the "" must read "" article it links to under the title ) about why this framework is absolutely false . "
1	159	 Some people in the Left support Israel and falsely accuse the other camp of being anti - Semitic , and some other people in the Left do not support Israel ( they may support the BDS campaign ) . 
1	159	 Many of the people in the Left who do not support Israel use an argument that many people perceive as an anti - Semitic argument ; this only helps the ruling class maintain its false framework for divide and rule . 
1	159	" The argument that many on the Left use and which is perceived to be anti - Semitic is this : "" The Israel lobby controls the American ruling class so effectively that it forces America 's rulers , against their will , to go against their own ( our own ) national interest and support Israel . "" "
1	159	" This theory is often known as "" tail wags dog "" ( the Israeli tail wags the United States dog ) and its proponents use phrases such as "" Congress is Israeli - occupied territory . "" "
1	159	" As I discuss in my article linked to above , the "" tail wags dog "" theory is factually wrong , and is able to derive credibility ( with difficulty since people know that tails do n't wag dogs ) only from the anti - Semitic canard that Jews have some mysterious power to control non - Jews ( an idea famously espoused by the fraudulent and infamous document named "" The Protocols of the Elders of Zion "" ) . "
1	159	 The result of the Left 's role in the debate about Israel is that the false framework ( that it 's anti - Semites versus non - anti - Semites ) remains reinforced by the Left , much to the delight of the ruling class . 
1	159	 What Will It Take to Win ? 
1	159	 In order for good people to win a genuinely equal and genuinely democratic society we must build a movement of the great majority of Americans that explicitly aims for an egalitarian revolutionary goal : to remove the ruling plutocracy from power to have no rich and no poor , with real democracy -- not the fake democracy that will always be the case as long as our society is one in which money is power and the billionaires have virtually all of it . 
1	159	 To create this movement it is necessary that its leaders know and assert that the great majority of Americans share this positive goal , despite secondary disagreements that the ruling class tries to maximize . 
1	159	 And it is necessary that its leaders explicitly advocate the egalitarian revolutionary goal , because otherwise it will never be adequately fought for and the ruling class will co - opt the movement with gimmicks ( such as campaign finance reform ) that leave it in power . 
1	159	 The problem is that our current leaders in the Left do not believe that the great majority of Americans share the positive values that ought to shape society . 
1	159	 They believe that about half of Americans are actually oppressors , and that ordinary Americans in general have quite negative values that first need to be changed before it would even be a good idea for them to have the real power in a genuine democracy . 
1	159	 The Left consequently does not even try to build the kind of movement that it takes to make a genuinely equal and democratic society , and it actually helps ( intentionally or not , it does n't matter ) the ruling class to divide - and - rule us . 
1	159	 I have written in my book , NO RICH AND NO POOR , and on my website ( www . 
1	159	 PDRBoston.org ) about building a movement -- an egalitarian revolutionary movement -- that can win what most people want . 
1	159	 Part of what is required is that we dump the Left . 
1	159	 The Left includes politicians such as President Obama and other leaders of the Democratic Party , pundits such as Robert Reich , and virtually all of the Marxist organizations and individuals . ( 
1	159	 The links in the previous sentence are to my articles explaining what is wrong with these people . ) 
1	159	 The Marxists demonstrated their ( to be kind ) worthlessness in the way they responded to one of the most divisive actions of the Left . 
1	159	" In 2015 a couple dozen Leftists blocked mainly white suburban commuters on I-93 in Massachusetts to deliberately piss them off , all in the name of "" anti - racism . "" "
1	159	" The message was that white working class people are the enemy of the anti - racist movement , the beneficiaries of "" white privilege . "" "
1	159	 This is exactly the divide - and - rule message that the ruling class promotes , and has been promoting since the days of slavery . 
1	159	 The leaders we need would have sharply denounced this action as a disgusting attack on working class people and an act that sent the ruling class 's Big Lie message . 
1	159	 Practically all - ordinary people ( except for hard core Leftists ) understood it to be a disgusting attack on innocent people , and they were pissed . 
1	159	" Many Left writers and organizations ( see here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here for example ) , however , praised ( either explicitly or by reporting it uncritically as an "" anti - racist "" action ) the I-93 blockade action , and those that did not explicitly praise it refused to say it was a bad thing to do ( see here and here and here for example ) . "
1	159	 No Left writers or organizations that I am aware of have said it was a bad thing to do . 
1	159	 The Left is perfectly fine with attacking white working class people in the name of black working class people . 
1	159	 This is how the Left , wittingly or not , foments race war in the U.S.A. 
1	159	 The reason good people are losing the fight against the ruling class is because we are following leaders who are actually our foes .

1	159	 The notion that the Marxist Left is working to end the inequality and fake democracy so loved by the capitalist ruling class has been wrong for a very long time . 
1	159	 As an example of how long this notion has been wrong , here 's an interesting fact reported in Antony Sutton 's book , Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution , published in 1974 ( and online here ) , from which one excerpt about a William Boyce Thompson is given below . 
1	159	 Thompson was at the very top of the American capitalist class when the Bolsheviks were in the process of taking power in Russia . 
1	159	 Thompson was President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ( the most important bank in the Federal Reserve system ) from 1914 to 1919 , the years about which Sutton writes . 
1	159	 Thompson was a very wealthy mining magnate and he was prominent in the Republican party , as one can read about in the first linked article about him above . 
1	159	 Here 's what Sutton reports : 
1	159	" Alzheimer's - Blocking "" Super Coffee "" May Be The "" Memory Saving Discovery "" Of The Century The Mysterious "" Secret Stock "" - It Could Fund Your Retirement How To Easily Kill 98 % Of Mold In Your Home "
1	159	" "" Thompson 's contribution to the Bolshevik cause was recorded in the contemporary American press . "
1	159	 The Washington Post of February 2 * , 1918 , carried the following paragraphs : 
1	159	 GIVES BOLSHEVIKI A MILLION 
1	159	 W. B. Thompson , Red Cross Donor , Believes Party Misrepresented . 
1	159	 New York , Feb. 2 ( 1918 ) . 
1	159	 William B. Thompson , who was in Petrograd from July until November last , has made a personal contribution of $ 1,000,000 to the Bolsheviki for the purpose of spreading their doctrine in Germany and Austria . 
1	159	 Mr. Thompson had an opportunity to study Russian conditions as head of the American Red Cross Mission , expenses of which also were largely defrayed by his personal contributions . 
1	159	 He believes that the Bolsheviki constitute the greatest power against Pro - Germanism in Russia and that their propaganda has been undermining the militarist regimes of the General Empires . 
1	159	 Mr. Thompson deprecates American criticism of the Bolsheviki . 
1	159	" He believes they have been misrepresented and has made the financial contribution to the cause in the belief that it will be money well spent for the future of Russia as well as for the Allied cause . "" [ "
1	159	 Kindle location 1412 . ] 
1	159	 Note that Thompson was in Petrograd before , during and after the Bolshevik October Revolution . 
1	159	 Sutton documents that Thompson 's support for the Bolsheviks was far from exceptional among his class of top level capitalists , and that these capitalists had backing from the Executive branch of the Federal government . [ 
1	159	 Read the book for all the gory details ! ] 
1	159	 One explanation for this apparently paradoxical alliance of capitalists and Lenin 's Bolsheviks is given by Sutton . 
1	159	 He argues that these capitalists were monopolists who made their fortunes by using the U.S. government -- the biggest monopoly of all , in their eyes -- as an instrument for personal enrichment , and that they saw that the highly centralized government that the Bolsheviks were creating could be equally useful to them as a government that would force the people of Russia to pay very high prices for American products .

1	159	" The Mysterious "" Secret Stock "" - It Could Fund Your Retirement "
1	159	 I am writing this article for an audience consisting of all the good people who , like myself , sincerely want a more equal and democratic society and who ( unlike myself ) , to achieve this goal , look for leadership from the prominent individuals and organizations that seem to share this goal . 
1	159	" Most of these leaders are commonly identified either as "" of the Left "" or "" progressive "" or "" liberal "" or "" Marxist . "" "
1	159	" In this article I will refer to all of these prominent leaders as "" the Left . "" "
1	159	 According to the standard wisdom , the Left is providing good leadership to achieve a more equal and democratic society and the problem is that not enough people follow this leadership , and so the enemies of the Left ( led by what I call the ruling class ) remain in power . 
1	159	 The problem , in this mistaken view , is that the Left is weak . 
1	159	 What I will show is that , on the contrary , the problem ( for those who want a more equal and democratic society , that is ) is that the Left is wrong . 
1	159	 What do I mean ? 
1	159	 The Left is wrong in its fundamental view of ordinary people , and because of this wrong view the ruling class is able to use the Left to divide and rule good people . 
1	159	 So let 's start by seeing what 's wrong with the Left 's view of ordinary people . 
1	159	 The Left 's Wrong View of Ordinary People 
1	159	 Before discussing the Left 's wrong view it helps to say what the truth is about ordinary people . 
1	159	 The truth is that the vast majority of ordinary people ( in the world , and in the United States as well ) want society to be based on the positive values of concern for one another ( as opposed to dog - eat - dog competition ) , mutual aid ( as opposed to some people taking unfair advantage of others ) and equality ( in the sense of having no rich and no poor and in the sense of ordinary people rather than a privileged and self - serving elite having the real say in social decisions . ) 
1	159	 This is why ordinary people are the solution , not the problem , today . 
1	159	 The Left disagrees . 
1	159	 The Left views the majority of ordinary people as the problem , not the solution , because their supposed values are the problem : selfishness and greed , racism , sexism , homophobia , transphobia , and the list grows all the time . 
1	159	 The Left believes that certain subsets of ordinary people ( people of color , non - heterosexuals , transgender people , etc . ) 
1	159	 are oppressed by the ordinary people who are different . 
1	159	 The solution , in this Leftist view , is to persuade the oppressive ordinary people to change their ugly ways and values . 
1	159	 The Marxist Left ( which I have written about here ) sometimes adds to the above an emphasis , more than the liberal / progressive leftists , on the issue of class : the material oppression of the working class by the capitalist class . 
1	159	 The Marxist Left thus , sharing the liberal / progressive left 's negative view of the deplorable values of ordinary people , points out that despite their terrible values working class people nonetheless have a class interest in opposing the ruling class . 
1	159	" The solution according to the Marxist Left is , again , to persuade ordinary people to change their ugly ways and values ( or , as the Marxists would say , to "" become class conscious . "" ) "
1	159	 The idea that the values of the vast majority of ordinary people are the solution , not the problem -- that they are the values that ought to shape society and are the opposite of the terrible values of the ruling class -- is the truthful idea that will enable good people to succeed in building a huge popular movement to make society genuinely equal and democratic . ( 
1	159	 A wonderful entire book about this is online here . ) 
1	159	 But hardly anybody knows how true this idea is , thanks to the ruling class propaganda against it and also thanks to the Left 's rejection of it . 
1	159	 Perhaps you , dear reader , think this idea is false . 
1	159	" If so , please read ( here ) about my experience at a pro - Trump rally asking random people there if they thought it was a good idea or a bad idea to "" remove the rich from power to have real , not fake , democracy with no rich and no poor . "" "
1	159	 86 % of them ( 43 out of the 50 I asked ) thought it was a good ( or great ! ) 
1	159	 idea and those 43 people all gladly took my button with that message and many pinned it onto themselves right on the spot . 
1	159	 Consider this please . 
1	159	 If ordinary people were as selfish and vile as the Left claims , then our world would be infinitely more horrible than it actually is , with everybody stabbing each other in the back and nobody giving a damn about anybody else . 
1	159	 This is the kind of world that it would be -- a veritable hellish nightmare of a world -- if the disgusting selfish competitive values of the ruling class were also those of everybody else . 
1	159	 The fact that our world is not this hellish nightmare , but one in which most people cooperate and help each other and respect one another as equals in countless ways that we take so much for granted that we do n't think about them or even notice them , this fact has huge significance : it shows that most ordinary people are the positive force in the world , a force that challenges capitalist values and that ought to shape all of society . 
1	159	 How the Ruling Class USES the Left to Divide and Rule Us 
1	159	 I have written a whole book(Divide and Rule ) about how the ruling class uses the Left to divide and rule us . 
1	159	 What follows is a brief summary with some links to some of my online articles treating particular issues in more detail . 
1	159	 Here 's how the ruling class uses the Left for divide - and - rule . 
1	159	" The ruling class takes ( or invents ) a "" hot button "" ( i.e. , potentially very divisive social issue ) and , with its control of the mainstream ( and alternative ! ) "
1	159	 media , it imposes a very particular framework on the public debate about the issue . 
1	159	 The framework is designed to be maximally divisive . 
1	159	" The framework is made maximally divisive by defining two opposing views ( I call them "" camps "" ) in a way that ensures that the people in each camp -- when they hear about the opposing camp -- will view the members of the opposing camp with utter contempt and possibly fear . "
1	159	 The ruling class does this by a ) providing each camp 's position with arguments designed to be maximally offensive to the other camp , and b ) censoring facts that , if known , would cause people in the opposing camps to see that they had far more agreement with each other than they otherwise would realize , and that the concerns of the opposing camp were quite reasonable ( instead of deplorable ) even if they still disagreed . 
1	159	 Here are some examples of how the ruling class uses the Left to make this work .

1	169	You can not vote for Donald Trump and pretend that this is just another election , and he is just another candidate . 
1	169	 Evan Vucci / AP 
1	169	 It 's easy to make fun of the hats . 
1	169	 It 's not so easy to contemplate what makes so many people think America 's greatness is in desperate need of reformation , or what would make them turn to someone like Donald Trump to make it a reality . 
1	169	 America has flaws as deep as its founding , when the men who laid down basic principles of human rights - principles that have endured 240 years - were fed and clothed by human beings they owned . 
1	169	 That paradox still defines the fault lines of our nation , and it 's along those lines we are drawing the ugliest election in modern history . 
1	169	 It is n't just economic anxiety or trade deals or the opioid epidemic driving the mostly white , mostly male movement behind Trump 's campaign . 
1	169	 It is the existential fear of displacement from a world that has slowly - too slowly , for too long - been chipping away at white male supremacy . 
1	169	" The "" grab 'em by the pussy "" moment was disastrous for Trump 's campaign ; it reinforced the defining narrative of his sexism . "
1	169	 But it drew his strongest supporters even closer to him , because it reminded them of the world they 're losing . 
1	169	 They want to live in an America where they can grab women by the pussy and brag about it to their friends . 
1	169	 They want to casually use the n - word - just for the bad ones ; they 're not racist ! - 
1	169	 without being set upon by the PC police . 
1	169	 They want what 's coming to them , what 's owed them . 
1	169	 And they are willing to burn down the world to get it . 
1	169	 Donald Trump is the worst major - party candidate for president in American history . 
1	169	 This is not a close call . 
1	169	 By virtually any measure , he is unfit to lead a Cub Scout troop , let alone the nation with the world 's most powerful military . 
1	169	 It 's worth going back and reading the transcripts of his debates with Hillary Clinton just to remember how he speaks when he 's answering questions off the cuff . 
1	169	 It 's breathtaking how incapable he is of forming a single coherent thought . 
1	169	 The expectations for him were so low that there was little to no coverage of his failure over four - and - a - half hours to say anything intelligent about any issue important to the American people . 
1	169	 He meanders , he interrupts , and he whines . 
1	169	 He is uninformed and unprepared . 
1	169	 Trump 's values are , in a word , deplorable . 
1	169	 He launched his campaign calling Mexican immigrants rapists , issued a call for a ban on immigration by Muslims , and said women should be punished for getting an abortion . 
1	169	 He lies , constantly , about everything . 
1	169	 He stokes anger and fear and even violence among his supporters . 
1	169	 He nurtures their very worst instincts . 
1	169	 He brags he has the best temperament , but that 's nonsense . 
1	169	 He 's lashed out and punched down , attacking the parents of a dead soldier , a former beauty pageant winner who gained weight , countless reporters and anyone he perceives as insulting him . 
1	169	 It is impossible to predict exactly how deep a disaster Donald Trump 's presidency would be , but there 's no limit to the potential for horror . 
1	169	 Think how much we still do n't know about Trump - how he has n't released his taxes , how many women there likely are who have n't come forward - and you can imagine the scandals and corruption that lie in wait . 
1	169	 Consider how thin his policy knowledge is and how impulsively he reacts to insults , and imagine his twitchy little fingers on the nuclear button . 
1	169	 Donald Trump can not be president of the United States . 
1	169	 And while Trump has a considerable movement of supporters who see him as a great conquering hero , who believe every word of his lies , no matter how outlandish and easily disproven , there are many people , even at this late hour , who are torn about whether they can support him . 
1	169	 Maybe they 're deeply conservative Republicans who despise what they believe Clinton would do to the country . 
1	169	 Maybe they 're independents who see constant stories about her emails and have genuine fears about her judgment . 
1	169	 But now is the moment for every last American to decide what it truly means to be a citizen . 
1	169	 You can be reluctant about Hillary Clinton . 
1	169	 You do n't even have to vote for her ( though I did , without doubt or hesitation ) . 
1	169	 What you can not do is vote for Donald Trump and pretend that this is just another election , and he is just another candidate . 
1	169	 It is your minimum duty as a citizen not to support a racist , sexist , unqualified , dishonest , corrupt manchild who celebrates everything that 's ugly about America and not a single thing that 's great about it . 
1	169	 No matter how left out or left behind you feel , voting for Trump is nothing short of a moral failure . 
1	169	 It 's a vicious act against the human beings , mostly women and people of color , who would suffer miserably under his presidency . 
1	169	 It 's an act of violence against America itself , whose greatness has always been about progressing from more oppression to less - slowly , sometimes haltingly , but forward . 
1	169	 The promise on those red hats is to turn back in the other direction . 
1	169	 The greatness they sell is a lie .

0	170	The Supreme Court says Theresa May does not have the power to trigger Article 50 alone What is Article 50 ? 
0	170	 Britain has to tell the EU that it wants to go by invoking Article 50 of the EU rulebook for the first time in history . 
0	170	 Article 50 , which is set out in the Lisbon Treaty , is the legal mechanism for the withdrawal of a member state from the EU . 
0	170	 The use of Article 50 will start the timer on a two - year process of exit talks over Britain 's political divorce from the 28-member bloc . 
0	170	 At the end of the two - year period , Britain will be expelled from the EU unless member states unanimously decide to extend the deadline . 
0	170	 When will Article 50 be triggered ? 
0	170	 The new Prime Minister Theresa May has said that she will trigger Article 50 before the end of March 2017 . 
0	170	 But the process could be delayed because the Government is being forced to get approval from Parliament in order to do so . 
0	170	 The Supreme Court has held up a High Court decision that the use Article 50 needs to be agreed by Parliament to the delight of EU voters . 
0	170	 Pro - EU will be given a fresh opportunity to try and block Brexit by voicing their concerns in the House of Commons and Lords . 
0	170	 There are fears that Brexit could be delayed until after the German election in autumn 2017 or even postponed indefinitely . 
0	170	 When must Article 50 be used by ? 
0	170	 There is no timescale for how soon after a referendum Article 50 must be invoked . 
0	170	 But the British Government is under pressure to start the process as soon as possible in order to put an end to the uncertainty that has engulfed Europe . 
0	170	" The European Council has said : "" We now expect the United Kingdom Government to give effect to this decision of the British people as soon as possible , however painful that process may be . "
0	170	" "" Any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty . "
0	170	" "" We have rules to deal with this in an orderly way . "

0	170	 After yesterday 's referendum , here is a look at what will happen immediately following the historic vote for Britain to leave the EU . 
0	170	 Brexit : What to expect next Is the EU referendum legally binding ? 
0	170	 The EU referendum result is not legally binding so in theory Parliament could ignore the will of the people by deciding to stay in the EU . 
0	170	" This is because Parliament is sovereign and the EU vote was an "" advisory referendum "" , as opposed to a "" binary "" referendum which has a fixed outcome . "
0	170	 Therefore the EU referendum legislation does not force the Government to automatically take Britain out of the EU . 
0	170	 But the political reality is that Theresa May 's Government has no choice but to follow through on the electorate 's wishes .

0	171	" In a hastily arranged press conference Friday night , Clinton said it was "" imperative "" for the FBI to "" explain this issue ... without delay . "" "
0	171	" Clinton said she is "" confident "" the conclusion reached in July about her emails will not change and downplayed its potential effect on the election . "
0	171	" "" I think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails , "" she said . "
0	171	 The new emails -- which potentially number in the thousands -- came from a laptop that had been shared by top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her now - estranged husband , Anthony Weiner , CBS News ' Jeff Pegues reported . 
0	171	" Asked if Abedin had shared with her what might have been discovered , Clinton said she had no information and "" we do n't know what to believe . "" "
0	171	" "" We 've heard these rumors , we do n't know what to believe , and I 'm sure there are going to be even more rumors , which is why it is incumbent on the FBI to tell us what is going on , "" Clinton said . "
0	171	" "" Right now , you 're guess is as good as mine , and that 's not good enough . "" "
0	171	 Clinton 's campaign said it had no advance knowledge of Comey 's letter , and the campaign staff found out about it only after the news had broken Friday afternoon , while Clinton was on a two - hour,15-minute flight traveling with staff and with reporters to Cedar Rapids , all of whom had little or no Wi - Fi access for most of the duration of the flight 
0	171	 Reporters shouted questions to Clinton as she walked from the plane in Cedar Rapids to the car that took her to her rally .

0	171	 Case reopened 
0	171	 — Jason Chaffetz ( @jasoninthehouse ) October 28 , 2016 
0	171	 Pegues confirmed Friday that the new batch of emails was discovered during the investigation into the August sexting scandal of Anthony Weiner , the husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin , after the agency seized electronic devices belonging to the couple . 
0	171	 Weiner was alleged to be exchanging sexually explicit messages with a 15-year - old girl . 
0	171	 Comey 's letter to Congress informed lawmakers that he was supplementing his previous testimony on the matter of the investigation , which was completed in July . 
0	171	 At the time , Comey recommended no charges against Hillary Clinton , which was accepted by the Justice Department . 
0	171	 Following the release of the FBI letter , House Speaker Paul Ryan reiterated his call for the Director of National Intelligence to stop giving classified briefings to Clinton , the Democratic presidential nominee . 
0	171	" "" This decision , long overdue , is the result of her reckless use of a private email server , and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators , "" Ryan said in a statement . "" "
0	171	" I renew my call for the Director of National Intelligence to suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved . "" "
0	171	 State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Friday that the Department is trying to figure out what these emails pertain to and whether they 're relevant to Clinton 's time as secretary of state . 
0	171	" Toner said they ca n't make any assumptions that they are , "" but they may be . "" "
0	171	 If so , Toner said the State Department is ready to cooperate with the FBI , but as of Friday afternoon , the department had not been contacted by the agency . 
0	171	" Donald Trump weighed in on the news at a Friday rally in Manchester , New Hampshire , saying that "" perhaps justice will be done "" after the FBI takes further investigative steps on the emails . "
0	171	" The audience roared , "" Lock her up ! "
0	171	" Lock her up , "" as Trump declared , "" Hillary Clinton 's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before ... We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office . "" "
0	171	" Trump also commended the FBI for now being "" willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made "" in announcing its investigation was complete . "
0	171	" "" This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood and it is everybody 's hope that it is about to be corrected , "" he said . "
0	171	" Later , Trump said of the "" system "" he has claimed to be "" rigged "" for several weeks : "" It might be not be as rigged as I thought . "

0	171	" John Podesta , Clinton 's campaign chair , called on Comey in a statement to "" immediately provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter "" sent to Senate and House committee chairmen . "
0	171	" "" Director Comey 's letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case , but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant , "" Podesta wrote Friday afternoon . "" "
0	171	 The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining . 
0	171	" We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July . "" "
0	171	 He added that , in the months since the email investigation was completed , partisan efforts have continued to undermine the agency . 
0	171	" "" Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second - guessing the FBI and , in both public and private , browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign , "" Podesta said . "

0	173	Hillary Clinton 's running mate , Tim Kaine , will be campaigning in Wisconsin Friday . 
0	173	" In a wide - ranging interview , he spoke to "" CBS This Morning 's "" Norah O'Donnell Thursday at his home state of Virginia . "
0	173	 He addressed the controversy surrounding the U.S. cash payment of $ 400 million to Iran , which Donald Trump claims is ransom for U.S. hostages released around the same time in January . 
0	173	 The Obama administration has strongly denied paying ransom . 
0	173	" "" If you were vice president , would you allow a plane full of money to land in Iran on the same day that four U.S. hostages are freed ? "" "
0	173	 O'Donnell asked . 
0	173	" "" Here 's the thing . "
0	173	 And Congress was briefed on this months ago . 
0	173	 Again , I 'm on these committees and we 're aware of it . 
0	173	 Iran had a sizeable legal claim against the United States that has been pending in international law for a very long time . 
0	173	 There was a settlement of that claim . 
0	173	 A settlement where the U.S. agreed to pay a fraction of the claim . 
0	173	" And yes , the U.S. then paid that claim , "" Kaine said . "
0	173	" "" I understand that , but let 's talk about the perception of on the very same day a plane with $ 400 million in foreign currency landing and being delivered . ... "
0	173	" Is that ransom ? "" "
0	173	 O'Donnell asked . 
0	173	" "" Perception is one thing . "
0	173	 Reality matters more . 
0	173	" We got hostages home and we took a legal claim that was a legit claim and bargained it down to a fraction and we paid that claim out , "" Kaine said . "" "
0	173	" That 's the reality . "" "
0	173	" "" So as vice president , you would do that same deal ? "
0	173	" If you were vice president you would let it happen ? "" "
0	173	 O'Donnell asked . 
0	173	" "" I would negotiate any legal claim that we had and I 'd try to get the best deal we could . "
0	173	" And I 'd also try to get American hostages home , "" Kaine said . "
0	173	" The Virginia senator , who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees , also addressed Trump 's claims that he saw a video of the cash transfer between U.S. and Iran showing "" money pouring off a plane . "" "
0	173	 Trump claimed the Iranian government released the footage to embarrass the U.S. 
0	173	" "" I have no idea what he 's talking about , "" Kaine said . "
0	173	" "" That video does n't exist ? "" "
0	173	 O'Donnell asked . 
0	173	" "" It does n't exist . "
0	173	 I-- he might be thinking about Iran Contra from , like , 35 years ago or something like this . 
0	173	" He recently criticized me saying I was a bad governor of New Jersey , "" Kaine said . "
0	173	 O'Donnell pointed out Trump may have confused Kaine with Tom Kean . 
0	173	" "" Tom [ Kean ] was the governor of Jersey 26 years ago . "
0	173	 I mean , so it hurt my feelings till I realized , ' Wait a minute . 
0	173	 I was never governor of New Jersey . 
0	173	 I did n't even live in New Jersey . ' 
0	173	 He was confusing it with a situation from two or three decades ago . 
0	173	" Maybe that 's what he 's doing with this video claim , "" Kaine said . "
0	173	" "" You think Donald Trump is confused ? "" "
0	173	 O'Donnell asked . 
0	173	" "" I absolutely think he 's confused , "" Kaine responded . "
0	173	 Campaigning in Kaine 's state of Virginia , Trump said he would take care of veterans better than anybody . 
0	173	" "" I do n't think anybody believes that , "" Kaine said . "" "
0	173	 I mean here 's what he 's done in my home state just in the last two weeks . ... 
0	173	 He trashed a Virginia family , the Khan family from Charlottesville , whose son is a UVA grad , who was a hero who was killed . 
0	173	 Trashed this Gold Star family . 
0	173	 He came to a rally in northern Virginia a couple of days ago and kicked a crying baby out of a rally . 
0	173	 And then he had the nerve to say to the crowd , ' Hey , things are going lousy for you here . ' 
0	173	 This is Loudoun County . 
0	173	 Loudoun County has the highest family income in the United States . ... 
0	173	 But he told them how bad things were . 
0	173	" This is not the way to win friends and influence people , to come into a state , trash military families , trash institutions that people care about and perpetrate sort of a falsehood about the state -- the state of the state 's economy . "" "
0	173	" Kaine also said Trump has "" spent his whole life bragging about how he uses every dodge he can to pay as few taxes as he can . "" "
0	173	" "" How do veterans services get supported ? "
0	173	 They get supported by people like you and me paying taxes because we want to honor their service and sacrifice . 
0	173	" A guy who tries to dodge paying taxes is no friend of vets , "" Kaine said . "
0	173	" "" At the Democratic convention , the former mayor of New York City , Michael Bloomberg , spoke and he said that Americans need a sane and competent president . "
0	173	" Do you think Donald Trump is sane and competent ? "" "
0	173	 O'Donnell asked . 
0	173	" "" Oh , I do n't know Donald Trump , so I 'm not gon na make any comment about mental capacity , et cetera . "
0	173	 Why would I do that ?

0	173	 But again , when you say things , they reveal who you are . 
0	173	" And when somebody shows you who they are , you oughta trust that . "" "
0	173	 While the Clinton campaign has embraced President Obama 's popularity , Kaine denied that a Clinton - Kaine administration would be a third Obama term . 
0	173	" "" And it 's not a third Bill Clinton term . "
0	173	 It is the first Hillary Clinton term . 
0	173	" And it 's very , very important that that be the case , "" Kaine said . "
0	173	" "" I think what you 're gon na see in Hillary Clinton 's choice of people around her when she gets in , is a very clear signal that we 're taking advantage of new talent , new ideas , innovative people . "
0	173	" Because this is the first Hillary Clinton term and I think she 's gon na make that plain from the very first day , "" he added . "
0	173	" "" But how are they different ? "
0	173	 It 's no secret that President Obama has not had the warmest of relations with Republicans in Congress . 
0	173	" And as a result , there 's been a lot of gridlock on a lot of really important issues facing this country , "" O'Donnell said . "" "
0	173	" What would [ Clinton ] do differently than President Obama ? "" "
0	173	" "" I would n't lay the gridlock just at President Obama 's feet , "" Kaine said . "" "
0	173	 Remember , before he even made his first visit to Congress there was a meeting of Congressional Republican leadership and they said , ' Our top goal is to make him a one term president . ' 
0	173	" So I think you have the put a good bit of that on Congress ' shoulders . "" "
0	173	 Kaine said he gets along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell . 
0	173	" "" But let me tell you what 's more important . "
0	173	 The number of Republicans who tell me , ' You know , Hillary was actually a really good senator . ' 
0	173	" They tell me that all the time , "" Kaine said . "
0	173	" "" So you think Hillary Clinton has better relationships with Republicans than Barack Obama ? "" "
0	173	 O'Donnell asked . 
0	173	" "" She was in the Senate for eight years and then four years as secretary of state , so she has got 12 years of working together with the Senate , "" Kaine said . "" "
0	173	 When the president was elected -- and I 'm a big supporter of President Obama and a friend -- he had been in the Senate four years . 
0	173	 Two years he was running . 
0	173	 So just in terms of the time into the relationships .

1	177	 Recently , Erin Elizabeth from HealthNutNews wrote up an expose about the past year 's findings concerning the many disappearances of holistic doctors . 
1	177	 In case you 're not aware , the confusing conundrum first began when Dr. Bradstreet was found dead exactly one year ago - yes , on Father 's Day - in the U.S. The noted autism doctor , researcher , and parent was found in a river with a gunshot wound to the chest . 
1	177	 While authorities at first thought his death was a result of suicide , it has since been confirmed that Dr. Bradstreet was murdered and that the wound was not self - inflicted . 
1	177	 His family , like the families of many other missing and dead naturopathic practitioners and MD doctors , believe that he was murdered for using and promoting controversial therapies , such as GCMaF. 
1	177	 According to Elizabeth , nearly 50 doctors have now died or gone missing under mysterious circumstances . 
1	177	 This riveting finding has resulted in some exposure on the topic - including articles by the New York Times , The Independent UK , and network affiliates such as ABC , CBS , NBC , FOX , but the whole story - or the many threads connecting the various murders- is not being told . 
1	177	 For this reason , the activist took to the internet today , on the one - year - anniversary of the first of the mysterious deaths , to express how serious of a concern these events are . 
1	177	 Right now in the United States , consumers are being told that they are not enough and that they must purchase more items on credit , eat high - fat , high - sugar foods , take prescription pills they can not afford , and buy into the fear - mongering propaganda . 
1	177	" In effect , America - perceived to be one of the most "" developed "" nations in the world - spends more on ‘ health care ' than any other affluent nation , yet still has the worst state of health as a collective . "
1	177	 Many suspect this is because a small elite controls the majority of corporations and mediaand , in effect , the government . 
1	177	 Unhealthy ideals are being pushed on the public for the sake of profit . 
1	177	 In fact , according to one Berkeley doctor , conventional treatments for concerns such as cancer are less effective than forgoing treatment in the first place . 
1	177	 Of course , if the public knew that eating healthier , getting exercise , thinking positive thoughts , simplifying their life , and letting go of toxic people and situations would dramatically transform their health , the world would be a much different place . 
1	177	 It seems that health practitioners that promote the idea that every individual can be their own doctor by taking responsibility for their own health rather than waiting for emergency medicine are being targeted , as they are going against a system which is corrupt and toxic . 
1	177	 Click KEEP READING to read the full story . 
1	177	 Or , at least , that 's what Elizabeth 's findings have concluded . 
1	177	 The activist 's attention on this topic may have earned her - and her colleagues - death threats , but the efforts have paid off . 
1	177	 A documentary is actually being made to shed more light on the mysterious deaths , and more information on that up - and - coming film will soon be shared . 
1	177	 Below is a detailed timeline of 34 doctors ' deaths within the last year . 
1	177	 We 'll let you be the judge on whether or not the untimely demise of many of these practitioners is fate or suspect . 
1	177	 What matters most is that if these doctors were killed because they 're practicing true medicine , the injustice is uncovered and the parties responsible pay for their crimes . 
1	177	 1 ) June 19th , 2015 
1	177	 Dr. Bradstreet formerly of Florida , and now practicing in Georgia , was found with a gunshot wound to his chest in a river . 
1	177	 The small town locals ruled the death almost immediately as a suicide , but many have their doubts . 
1	177	 This same day in Mexico , June 19th , 2015 , three doctors were traveling to the State Capital to deliver some papers and were reported missing . 
1	177	 This is the only case outside of the U.S. Authorities said they found the bodies , but the families say those bodies look nothing like their family members and they are demanding more proof and more testing . 
1	177	 A sad but riveting article was written about those details here . 
1	177	 I also did an exclusive interview with the Bradstreet family as they publicly said I was the only journalist they trusted to talk about the horrific incident . 
1	177	 2 ) June 21st , 2015 
1	177	 Father 's Day , Florida East Coast : Two chiropractors are found dead . 
1	177	 Their names are Dr. Baron Holt and Dr. Bruce Hendendal , both fathers . 
1	177	 Dr. Hedendal also held a PhD in nutrition from Harvard . 
1	177	 Both were presumably healthy and described as very fit . 
1	177	 There is still no cause of death listed , for either doctor in any articles we find . 
1	177	 A few people have contacted me about Dr. Hedendal , 67 , but admit that they were surprised by his death and still find it shocking . ( 
1	177	 Update : Family and loved ones of Dr. Hedendal have spoken to the media that they are suspicious of his death and want answers . 
1	177	 Interestingly , Dr. Holt ( 33 ) , lived in North Carolina which is the state where Dr. Bradstreet 's body ( the first doctor to be found ) was discovered two days prior . 
1	177	 Dr. Holt was visiting Jacksonville , Florida , though , when he died there . 
1	177	 Dr. Bradstreet ( see story # 1 ) was living in Georgia at the time of his death and before that he lived in the neighboring state of Florida . 
1	177	 A few mutual friends of Dr. Holt have contacted me . 
1	177	 They are doctors and have shared with me a cause of death that I find rather shocking and can not confirm , therefore , out of respect for the family , I will not list that here . 
1	177	 Both were well loved by their patients , community , friends and family . )

1	177	 Her husband and children were in Connecticut at a family reunion when she was murdered . 
1	177	" The authorities have been investigating for two weeks "" around the clock , "" and now say that she was targeted . "
1	177	" Her murder was not random nor was it a home invasion and when the facts come out , "" books and movies will be written about it . "" "
1	177	 It 's that big of a story . 
1	177	" On the very same day , June 29th , Jeffrey Whiteside , MD , a pulmonologist , went missing- vanishing when he simply "" walked away "" . "
1	177	 Dr. Whiteside , known for his successful treatment of lung cancer , disappeared in Door County , Wisconsin while vacationing with family . 
1	177	" He was on foot and numerous reports have called it "" mysterious , "" saying he vanished without a trace . "
1	177	 They 've been searching now for three weeks and even colleagues have joined in ( along with bloodhounds , drones search parties , and helicopters ) but not one shred of evidence has surfaced . ( 
1	177	" UPDATE : Two arrests were made in the death of Teresa Sievers and one of the assailants called himself the "" Hammer "" on Facebook ( Dr. Sievers was allegedly killed with a hammer ) . "
1	177	 The other was one of her husband 's childhood friends who was just recently extradited to Florida . 
1	177	 His attorney says there is evidence to show he had no involvement whatsoever with the crime . 
1	177	 Her husband , Mark Sievers , has not been arrested at this time . )

1	177	 The search has expanded but authorities say it 's as if he vanished without a trace . 
1	177	 He 's 6′ tall and described as Irish - looking with a goatee ( details can be found in the links ) . 
1	177	 5 ) July 10th , 2015 
1	177	 Lisa Riley , 34 years old , DO ( Doctor of Osteopathic medicine ) is found in her home with a gunshot wound to her head . 
1	177	 Her husband who found her and called 911 , has a prior record . 
1	177	 He was previously charged with the attempted murder of his ex , Ms. King , before charges were eventually dropped . 
1	177	 Evidence showed that there was gun residue found on Ms. King 's hand and not Mr. Riley 's . 
1	177	 Riley 's story corroborated this , but King 's allegedly did n't , and her story kept changing ( click link in this paragraph for their story with details on all of this ) . 
1	177	 Mr. Riley has since been charged with the death of his wife , Lisa Riley . 
1	177	 We 'll see what happens in court .

1	177	 Sadly , he was shot to death . 
1	177	 We do n't know if he was holistic , but he was licensed and lived between Florida and Georgia .

1	177	 The same day another holistic doctor is also found dead ( see below ) . 
1	177	 They both allegedly died of heart attacks , though their own friends and family say publicly it does n't add up . 
1	177	 I had met Dr Gonzalez and his amazing wife , and my better half has interviewed him several times . 
1	177	 His official website says that while they initially thought it was a heart attack , his autopsy does not support that belief and shows no heart attack . 
1	177	" They are awaiting further tests . "" "
1	177	" Dr Gonzalez was in excellent health otherwise so his passing is quite unexpected . "" "
1	177	 It is reported that he was alone at the time of his death . 
1	177	" Countless people every week ( including close friends ) write me questioning the fact that he died "" naturally "" . "
1	177	 He also said in several interviews ( including the last one before he died ) that he thought big pharma wanted him to get hit by a bus or that he might die suddenly . 
1	177	 Frightening metaphors and a mystery we hope to get to the bottom of soon . 
1	177	 8) July 21st , 2015 
1	177	 Dr Abdul Karim , an outspoken and loved holistic ( biological ) dentist , 41 years of age , is found dead alongside the road by a passerby . 
1	177	 He had been preparing for a half marathon and was allegedly out training that night . 
1	177	 His old fraternity brother ( lifelong friends ) , friends of many years , and patients said it did n't add up .

1	177	" I report that Jeffrey Whiteside 's death is officially ruled as a suicide but the local press calls the investigation a "" mess "" ( described here in detail ) . "
1	177	 Many are shocked at how long it took for details to emerge and countless people write me with their doubts . 
1	177	 Even local authorities were asked by the local press if they 'd heard of my stories . 
1	177	 They admitted they had , but had n't been contacted by the feds on the case . 
1	177	 12 ) September 7 , 2015 
1	177	 I broke the news to the health community of 29 holistic doctors ( also referred to in the German press as homeopaths / ND's / psychiatrists ) who were found poisoned by an overdose of a hallucinogenic drug . 
1	177	 I 've done several updates of the articles , using a German translator , but the whole story of what really happened has still not been revealed . 
1	177	" One thing most can agree on ; it was a large overdose and mainstream German news reports that some were in "" life threatening situations "" when dozens of ambulances and a helicopter arrived to the chaotic scene . "
1	177	 The good news ? 
1	177	 All lived and have allegedly made a full recovery ( though some had to be restrained for their safety for some time ) . 
1	177	 13 ) September 16 , 2015 
1	177	 I reported that our colleague , best selling author and holistic MD , Mitch Gaynor , is found dead outside his country home ; an hour or so from Manhattan where he practiced . 
1	177	 We knew Dr Gaynor and had just finished an advanced copy of his book that he had sent to us . 
1	177	 It was quickly called a suicide by the local sheriff . 
1	177	 The NY Times wrote me asking for details and we had a nice exchange . 
1	177	 Even though I have gently broken the news on this and many other stories , the NY Times fails to source me ( I did n't expect them to source HealthNutNews , though the Guardian UK and other mainstream sources have for some time ) . 
1	177	 UPDATE : Mitch Gaynor , MD had been on RT not long before he died . 
1	177	 We wanted to contact them for comment , but soon after Mitch was found dead ?

1	177	 Unlike the 3 others by this date who were alleged suicides ( one who has been officially confirmed ) we do n't know the location where Dr Paas was found , nor the details of her alleged suicide . 
1	177	 Many seem concerned for her pets , who they say she loved very much .

1	177	 We also have more deaths of doctors here : some described as freak accidents . 
1	177	 Again , we did n't include them in the official unintended series . 
1	177	 We have the famous holistic ABC News doctor , Jamie Zimmerman , who allegedly slipped and fell and hit her head in Hawaii while on vacation , and who was carried out to sea . 
1	177	 We also have more accidental deaths of holistic doctors here in NY ( accidental ) , and yet another here of a famous holistic MD ! 
1	177	 We literally could n't keep up at times there were so many . 
1	177	 17 ) Late December 2015 
1	177	 January 2016 I did n't include PhD 's in the series ( unless they were also an MD , DO or DC ) but then just this past few weeks we saw 2 Canadian PhD's / researchers killed . 
1	177	 One was stabbed in what his friends called a safe neighborhood . 
1	177	 Another , a Phd ( who was a wife and mother of two ) was hit while jogging near the beach and then buried in a shallow grave on the tourist island of Grenada . 
1	177	 Then days later a holistic doctor is also attacked there with his wife ( physician 's assistant ) on this same tiny island of Grenada ( see # 18 ) . 
1	177	 This is where we suddenly start seeing a spate of cancer researchers killed which had n't happened previously and then suddenly we have a one every few days . 
1	177	 18 ) January 23 , 2016 
1	177	 A top MD , John Marshall , 49 , who was a former 4th generation Marine , had served in Afghanistan , and had survival training , was found dead in the Spokane river and they pulled his body out that day . 
1	177	 He was said to be in great shape and was doing his usual run in Spokane , near the river . 
1	177	 Authorities say he somehow must have fallen into the river and drowned and almost immediately said it was death by drowning . ( 
1	177	 UPDATE : Dr Marshall 's wife ( also a doctor and surgeon ) has hired her own investigator and is questioning the quick call by Seattle PD . 
1	177	 Again , more families are questioning these deaths and what some find absurd rulings by authorities . )

1	177	 Our own friend of ten long years , holistic doctor Rod Floyd , was found dead at his home here in Florida . 
1	177	 He just miles from us and I 'd been to their home and they 'd been to mine . 
1	177	" It was definitely not suicide in any way and his wife of 37 years says he was "" hearty and healthy "" and calls it an accident . "
1	177	 That 's all I 'll elaborate on right now , as even I do n't know all the details . 
1	177	 Dr Floyd did buy a sauna from me ( but that was n't involved in his death which I was told initially ) . 
1	177	 Besides being a chiropractor , Dr Floyd was also a clinical professor at Palmer Chiropractor College near where we live . 
1	177	 He and his wife have also run the Natural Awakenings magazine for some time . 
1	177	 Our whole community is shocked and saddened by his death . 
1	177	 20 ) January 26 , 2016 
1	177	 Believe it or not just a few short weeks later , a holistic MD and his wife ( a physician 's assistant ) were attacked , while on a relaxing beach stroll , by a sword wielding man in the same place- the tiny island of Grenada . 
1	177	 The holistic MD survived . 
1	177	 Sadly his wife was murdered and raped by the machete wielding attacker . 
1	177	 Both perps in each attack of the doctors in Grenada in a couple of weeks are reported to have been recently released from prison and in both crimes ( allegedly unrelated ) the men just nonchalantly turned themselves in after the crime . 
1	177	 Some experts have their theories on this . 
1	177	 I wo n't elaborate at this time . 
1	177	 Grenada locals are shocked and say they 've never seen anything like this- let alone twice in a row .

1	177	 The new spate of cancer researcher / doctors who are killed or found dead does n't slow down and this might be the strangest of them all : Yet another cancer researcher , Professor Alan Clarke , 52 , was found dead in the wood in hanging from a tree in a rubber body suit on December 28th , 2015 and they ruled it accidental .

1	177	 Just a week later , to the day , after losing our local friend and holistic doctor ; Rod Floyd we lost another local friend also right here in our same local holistic community . 
1	177	 The wonderful young Paige Adams FNP , B - C , also lived just up the road here locally in Florida was found dead at her home . 
1	177	 She had worked closely for many years with her good friend and colleague Dr Bradstreet . 
1	177	 The problem is Dr Bradstreet started off this whole holistic series when he was found dead in a river . 
1	177	 Now we have his close friend ( and our friend ! ) 
1	177	 and his colleague of many years found dead . 
1	177	 She was so young so this is particularly heartbreaking . 
1	177	 Paige Adams had asked to stop by the house to see us days before she died . 
1	177	 I feel awful for not taking her up on that , and my heart goes out to her family and patients . 
1	177	 She is the only one in this entire series I 've ever written about who is not a doctor of some sort ( DC , MD , DO , and even a PhD at the end ) But she was a board certified Nurse Practitioner whose patients rave about her endlessly . 
1	177	 She also stated publicly ( which you 'll see in the link ) that if anything happened to her do n't assume it was an accident .

1	177	 Investigators quickly state they ca n't see any evidence that it 's a homicide , but her mother and other relatives state publicly there is no way she crawled 1.5 miles through brambles and water and mud to put a plastic bag over her head in a culvert . 
1	177	 They stated that if she would have wanted to take her life ( and listed plenty of reasons why she would n't with a happy family and job at the famous cancer research lab ) she could have done it much more easily . 
1	177	 The general public tends to agree with the family .

1	177	 Some are hiring their own investigators and doubting local authorities . 
1	177	 Many are wondering if the local authorities are to be trusted .

1	177	 An arrest was made in the death of holistic doctor Mary Louise Yoder . 
1	177	 The curious part is that Dr. Yoder actually died in or around July 22nd 2015 ( last year - a very busy week for holistic doctor deaths ) and authorities almost immediately said she died of natural causes despite being fit , uber healthy and just 60 years old . 
1	177	 I did not include her in the series originally since the authorities mistakenly said it was natural . 
1	177	 So oftentimes we have authorities making these quick calls only to find out later they were completely false ( why the rush officers ? ) 
1	177	" So for months , Yoder 's death was considered "" natural "" until reports say a family member demanded an investigation . "
1	177	 Now , this June , her employee ( who was listed as her daughter on her obituary - they were so close ) was arrested and it 's said she poisoned her . 
1	177	 The employee is only 23 years old and had said Yoder meant the world to her . 
1	177	 Keep updated on this story as new details may emerge .

1	179	 South Park is one of television 's longest - running shows , a 20-seasons - and - counting award - winning cultural behemoth that has spawned movies , imitations , and countless time - wasting memes . 
1	179	 But could the show be , at least in part , responsible for one of the scariest political movements of the present moment ? 
1	179	 Lindsey Weedston thinks so . 
1	179	 Weedston , a 29-year - old writer from Bothell , Washington , penned an article for The Establishment recently which argued that the show helped lead to the rise of the alt - right . 
1	179	" The piece , "" How ' South Park ' Helped Empower the Alt - Right , "" grabbed my attention enough that I decided to call her up and see why exactly she thought Kyle , Cartman , and crew led us to Richard Spencer , 4Chan , and Charlottesville . "
1	179	 Our conversation , edited lightly for length and clarity , is below . 
1	179	" To start off , how does South Park treat what some people might think of as "" PC culture "" ? "
1	179	 I read a post that explained this really well — South Park 's highest moral goal is to not care . 
1	179	 It treats PC culture as [ if ] the opposite of PC culture is not to care about anything . 
1	179	 So caring about an issue is basically stupid , and pretty much every episode goes back to : it does n't matter , being PC is uncool , and not giving a fuck about anything is the way you should feel . 
1	179	 In your article you trace a history of that attitude , starting with the misinterpretation of a character in an Oliver Stone movie . 
1	179	 Can you take me through that ? 
1	179	 That was interesting . 
1	179	 So [ the 1987 movie ] Wall Street , I did n't know before I researched for the article that Oliver Stone actually meant it the opposite of how so many people took it . 
1	179	 Wall Street was supposed to be an indictment of Wall Street and the type of person that thinks greed is good . 
1	179	" It was very interesting to find that so many people actually went with the mantra "" greed is good , "" and it seems like that has shaped a lot of our culture . "
1	179	 Now we have prosperity Christianity — actually telling people that God wants them to collect as much wealth as possible . 
1	179	 It 's not just Wall Street . 
1	179	 For a long time , our capitalist society has led up to this idea that the ultimate goal is to collect as much wealth as possible . 
1	179	 That movie accelerated the idea of collecting all the wealth and power you can . 
1	179	 And then you talk about shock jock 's of the ' 80s and ' 90s , the Howard Sterns of the world . 
1	179	 What does that have to do with the South Park - popularized attitude of caring being uncool ? 
1	179	" The original title of this article I pitched was actually "" The History of Celebrated Assholes . "" "
1	179	 My first draft of the piece , I ended up researching early forms of shock and asshole comedy . 
1	179	 I found out the person considered the first shock jock was actually a black man , Petey Greene . 
1	179	 Howard Stern was influenced by him . 
1	179	 It 's really interesting to learn the kind of things he talked about . 
1	179	 He was appealing because he was very down to Earth , and he spoke to the black community in a very straightforward way that no white disk jockey had ever before . 
1	179	 When Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. was assassinated , he went on air and started speaking to the community , and is credited with calming the situation down . 
1	179	 You can go on YouTube and find some of the shows and listen to the way he speaks . 
1	179	 It 's very colloquial . 
1	179	 He just acts like a normal person . 
1	179	 I think white people at the time looked at that as being shocking , and that 's why he was labeled as a shock jock . 
1	179	 He was really active in the community . 
1	179	 He promoted education and feeding the hungry . 
1	179	 He was n't an asshole , but history is very interesting . 
1	179	 In my original draft , I wrote about how he influenced Howard Stern . 
1	179	 Howard Stern was actually invited onto his show . 
1	179	 Stern went on in black face and used the n word , and Greene thought it was funny . 
1	179	 Greene died fairly young , so then you move onto Howard Stern 's career . 
1	179	 Howard Stern , I 'm sure , has done some good stuff in his life . 
1	179	 But he is very much associated with the shock jock label , and a lot of what he does is just to rile people up . 
1	179	 I think it 's interesting how you have that transition from somebody who was just being real and communicating to his people in a way that made sense to him ; and then you have Howard Stern , who makes a lot of money — and in fact an entire career — from pissing people off . 
1	179	 How do you get to the alt - right from that ? 
1	179	 How does South Park 's overall attitude connect to the alt - right ? 
1	179	 I believe that South Park 's anti - PC messages paved the way for white supremacist groups to recruit much of the largely white male fanbase into what is now referred to as the alt - right , or other groups that are identical in all but name . 
1	179	 Matt and Trey promoted this idea that you should be able to say or animate anything you want in the name of satire and humor , and any harm that it caused either did n't exist or did n't matter . 
1	179	" When they experienced backlash for their intensifying mockery of already - vulnerable groups and their attitude of , "" Repeating horrible things said by bigots up to and including Nazis is funny because it upsets people , "" they reacted by depicting their critics as free - speech - oppressing caricatures like the "" PC bro . "" "
1	179	" They promoted the idea that marginalized people — trans people , people of color , Jewish people , etc .— speaking out against harm caused by South Park 's brand of "" humor "" and [ the show 's ] "" I do what I want "" attitude are the real oppressors . "
1	179	" White supremacist groups and their better - at - PR counterpart the "" alt - right "" use this message constantly to recruit young white men and boys . "
1	179	 They tell these kids that they 're the ones being oppressed by those telling them that they have privilege , and therefore need to make some effort to at least not use certain words and maybe examine prejudiced attitudes they might have picked up from a culture that is prejudiced in many ways . 
1	179	" The alt - right promotes the idea of white male victimization , drawing in youth that has been told by South Park that the plight of marginalized groups does n't matter and that "" political correctness "" is oppressing them . "
1	179	" Once those groups have their loyalty , they can then indoctrinate these young guys into straight up white supremacist ideas under the guise that "" the PC police do n't want you to think about this . "" "
1	179	 I do n't think Matt and Trey meant to create an army for the alt - right , but they seem to be leaning into it rather than admitting that they might have messed up . 
1	179	 Cartman plays a big part in your article . 
1	179	 He 's often not the hero in the storylines of the individual episodes , but he is a fan favorite . 
1	179	 Can you break down why that 's a problem ? 
1	179	 Cartman is a perfect representation of satire gone wrong . 
1	179	 Just like with Wall Street , the people who view your content take the literal meaning of something instead of taking it as the indictment that it is . 
1	179	 It 's pretty clear , especially in the earlier episodes , that you 're not supposed to like Cartman . 
1	179	 You are n't supposed to identify with him . 
1	179	 You 're supposed to hate him , or at least understand he is the opposite of the ideal of a human being . 
1	179	 That is supposed to be represented in his bigotry , his ignorance , and his appearance as well , with him being fat . 
1	179	 And yet he is a fan favorite , and people do identify with him . 
1	179	 I think it was Matt Stone who said he identifies with Cartman more than any of the other characters . 
1	179	 I think their original intention was to say , okay , do n't be like Cartman . 
1	179	 But instead , you have the opposite reaction of people idealizing his attitude and his selfishness and his desire to make people suffer and his bigotry . 
1	179	 He has become a representation of how the fans feel that you should be . 
1	179	" Can you talk about "" South Park Republicans ""— South Park being adopted by right wingers ? "
1	179	 That plays into what I think is the logical conclusion of the anti - PC movement . 
1	179	 Like I said in the article , there has been a rebellion against this idea of being PC . 
1	179	 Political correctness has evolved into a derogatory term meaning , you are being sensitive to someone . 
1	179	 It has become this big boogeyman . 
1	179	 There is an idea that there is this social justice warrior , PC police entity who will come and yell at you and punish you if you say what you are actually thinking . 
1	179	 So there has been a rebellion against this strawman . 
1	179	 It has come down to , if you care about anyone at all , if you want to be sensitive to anyone 's needs , then you 're this politically correct nerd or you 're a nun with a ruler or an authority figure telling people what to do . 
1	179	 You are therefore uncool and the enemy . 
1	179	 It 's very reactionary . 
1	179	 But it 's so popular and so widespread on the right now , and you actually have people coming out with articles and people in the White House using that rhetoric to help further their political careers . 
1	179	 So it 's really not surprising to me that there articles out there saying South Park is right on actual political issues . 
1	179	 What has followed South Park 's wake ? 
1	179	 The first example that comes to mind is a lot of the cultural treatment of trans people . 
1	179	 South Park has had some really transphobic content . 
1	179	 Even before the Caitlyn Jenner episode , there was the whole treatment of Mr. Garrison and his sex change . 
1	179	" I remember the episode where they included footage of an actual gender affirmation surgery , just saying , "" look how gross this is . "" "
1	179	" They had a caption like , "" This is footage of the actual surgery , "" as though it 's supposed to be horrible and sad because it 's gross . "
1	179	 But any surgery looks gross and disgusting . 
1	179	 Their definite goal was to be like , this is gross and this is wrong . 
1	179	 You see a huge amount of transphobia from a lot of alt - right groups . 
1	179	 You have these bathroom bills that are trying to keep trans people out of public restrooms , which is basically keeping them out of public life . 
1	179	 It 's trying to keep them from having access to any kind of normal life . 
1	179	 The sudden emergence of the bathroom bills surprised me , but maybe it should n't have . 
1	179	 It seemed to come out of nowhere , but then you look at the timing and it does kind of follow Caitlyn Jenner 's coming out to the public as a woman . 
1	179	 That in itself probably would have gotten some backlash , but then you look at how popular South Park is , and there 's no way it did n't play a role in people reacting the way they did : reacting like , oh that 's just so gross — their existence is gross and wrong . 
1	179	 You end your essay with a call for what you call radical kindness . 
1	179	 What does that mean ? 
1	179	 Radical kindness comes from being around young people , specifically in communities that are more social justice - oriented . 
1	179	 In my community , I 'm seeing a shift towards memes being positive and used to uplift people . 
1	179	 I think people are just tired of beating on each other and attacking each other , and the younger generations especially are starting to rebel against that . 
1	179	 I feel like a lot of what my generation , millennials , has put out there has been negative . 
1	179	 We 're kind of a depressed generation , so I think younger people are reacting to that and deciding , let 's be nice to each other . 
1	179	 In a society where being mean to each other is the norm , kindness is punk . 
1	179	 That 's rebelling . 
1	179	 That 's what 's cool .South Park Provoked the Rise of White Supremacists — Here 's How
0	180	When it comes to illegal smuggling , criminals will try to push anything for a profit .

0	180	 Police ordered the cargo to be unloaded and inspected to ensure it was n't anything illegal . 
0	180	 There was a lot to go through , but they needed to be certain there was n't anything unlawful slipping into the country .

0	180	 When the police finally uncovered what was being transported , they were horrified .

1	184	There 's been a lot of talk this week about President Trump 's mental state . 
1	184	" Psychiatrists have weighed in calling him a "" very sick man . "" "
1	184	" Former associates report that people close to him are "" deeply concerned about his mental health . "" "
1	184	" It 's been reported that he 's telling people that the person on the "" Access Hollywood "" tape was n't really him , and claiming ( again ) that he actually won the popular vote . "
1	184	 But the most vivid and obvious evidence that Trump is becoming even more unbalanced even than before ( which is saying something ) comes from his Twitter feed , which has been a daily dumpster fire ever since word came down that Michael Flynn had apparently made a deal with Robert Mueller . 
1	184	 Trump 's Twitter is a window into his mind , and right now it is n't offering an attractive view . 
1	184	 He 's madly tweeted lies about his tax plan , applauded himself for single - handedly causing the stock market to rise , insulted the media , slandered old friends and condemned some of the famous men who have been fired for sexual harassment . 
1	184	 Apparently he is more assured of his omnipotence than ever , since he was rewarded with the presidency while all those other guys have been brought low . 
1	184	 He 's put on quite a show and all of it has further degraded the presidency and embarrassed the nation before the world . 
1	184	 But there was one series of tweets that stood out and it 's so bad that it may have actually caused a diplomatic break with our closest ally . 
1	184	 On Thursday morning , for some inexplicable reason , the president of the United States retweeted three videos claiming to be Muslim extremists perpetrating violence . 
1	184	 One purported to show a group of Muslims pushing a boy off a roof , another claimed to show a Muslim destroying a statue of the Virgin Mary and a third supposedly showed a Muslim immigrant hitting a Dutch boy on crutches . 
1	184	 The Dutch embassy clarified that the third video actually of two native - born dutch boys fighting , and did not involve Muslim immigrants at all . 
1	184	 The tweets were from a vile British neofascist named Jayda Fransen , the deputy leader of a tiny far - right , anti - immigrant group called Britain First . 
1	184	" You may recall that prior to the Brexit vote last year a Labour Party member of Parliament named Jo Cox was assassinated by a man who shouted the words "" Britain First "" before he killed her . "
1	184	 According to the Daily Beast : 
1	184	" The group had previously struggled to garner mainstream - media coverage of their video stunts , which include mosque "" invasions "" and "" Christian patrols "" during which uniformed thugs carrying white crosses attempt to intimidate minority citizens . "
1	184	 On Wednesday , Trump catapulted Fransen and the group 's leader Paul Golding , who is also a convicted criminal , into the global conversation . 
1	184	 Trump sent those videos out to his millions of followers ; hundreds of millions more may have seen them through other social media and mainstream news by now . 
1	184	 These anti - Muslim videos are the worst kind of hate propaganda , the kind of thing one expects to find deep in the bowels of the extremist right - wing internet . 
1	184	" Needless to say , Fransen was delighted and thanked Trumpfor "" sharing the videos with his "" 44 MILLION FOLLOWERS ! "
1	184	 GOD BLESS YOU TRUMP ! 
1	184	" GOD BLESS AMERICA ! "" "
1	184	 The reaction was swift . 
1	184	" Prime Minister Theresa May 's office rebuked the president in a statement which said that Britain First "" divides communities in their use of hateful narratives which pedal lies and stoke tensions . "
1	184	 This causes anxieties to law - abiding people . 
1	184	 The British people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far right , which is the antithesis of the values that this country represents ; decency , tolerance and respect . 
1	184	" It is wrong for the President to have done this . "" "
1	184	 Trump himself was not contrite , of course . 
1	184	 He responded this way : 
1	184	 . 
1	184	 @Theresa_May , do n't focus on me , focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom . 
1	184	 We are doing just fine ! 
1	184	 — Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) November 30 , 2017 
1	184	 The British Parliament did not take this well . 
1	184	 In speech after speech members demanded that Trump 's invitation for a state visit ( already controversial ) be rescinded . 
1	184	" Labor M.P. Stephen Doughty declared that by sharing those tweets , Trump had shown himself to be "" either a racist , incompetent or unthinking — or all three . "
1	184	" I love America , it is a country and people of extraordinary generosity , courage , kindness and humanity — but this president represents none of those things . "" "
1	184	" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said May should use "" any influence she and her government claim to have with the president "" to ask that he "" delete these tweets and to apologize to the British people . "" "
1	184	 None of that is going to happen , of course . 
1	184	 Trump 's state of mind at the moment is that following his racist instincts are what got him to the most powerful office on earth and following those instincts is the winning formula going forward . 
1	184	 We are all well aware of Trump 's bond with the old - fashioned American far right . 
1	184	 David Duke is a big fan and applauded him for retweeting the videos . 
1	184	" Trump thinks that one can be a "" very fine person "" and still carry a torch and march with Nazis shouting "" Jews will not replace us "" in American cities . "
1	184	 His xenophobic rhetoric toward Mexicans and Muslims , and his barely concealed racism , have been obvious for years and were major selling points during his campaign . 
1	184	 Trump has also shown an affinity for the neofascist right in Europe , perhaps under the influence of Steve Bannon , who has developed alliances with such groups for some time through his Breitbart International media venture . 
1	184	" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said later that Trump did not know who Jayda Fransen was before he retweeted her , and claimed he was trying to "" elevate the issue "" of extremist violence in Europe . "
1	184	 That 's not enough . 
1	184	 He has been retweeting white supremacists and neofascists for a long time . 
1	184	 Quite likely he does n't know who they all are either , but he obviously likes what they have to say and he 's happy to use his platform of tens of millions of followers and the prestige of the White House to spread their message far and wide . 
1	184	 May did not rescind the invitation to the state visit . 
1	184	 But the British do n't seem to be in any hurry to set a date either . 
1	184	" Plans for a "" working visit "" from Trump in January have been dropped , which seems wise . "
1	184	 Our president seems to have done something that nobody else has been able to do in Britain lately : He brought left and right together -- in mutual loathing for him .

0	185	 QUANTICO , Va. — President Donald Trump laced into FBI leadership Friday , while proclaiming his loyalty and support for law enforcement in an address at the agency 's training academy . 
0	185	" "" It 's a shame what 's happened "" with the FBI , the president said as he left the White House for a speech at the FBI training academy in Quantico , Virginia . "
0	185	" He called the agency 's handling of Hillary Clinton 's email investigation "" really disgraceful "" and told reporters "" we 're going to rebuild the FBI . "" "
0	185	 Shortly afterward , Trump lavished praise on graduates of a weeks - long FBI National Academy program and their families , touting their accomplishments and pledging his unwavering support . 
0	185	" Trump told law enforcement leaders he is "" more loyal than anyone else could be "" to police . "
0	185	" "" Anti - police sentiment is wrong and it 's dangerous , "" he added . "" "
0	185	" Anyone who kills a police officer should get the death penalty . "" "
0	185	 Trump used the speech to promote his administration 's tough - on - crime policies , delivering a stern warning to members of the international gang MS-13 that his administration will root them out and arrest them . 
0	185	 He also celebrated his decision to make it easier for local police forces to purchase surplus military equipment , and questioned rising violence in Chicago . 
0	185	" "" What the hell is going on in Chicago ? "
0	185	" What the hell is happening there , "" he asked . "
0	185	" Hours before , White House Deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News Channel that edits to former FBI Director James Comey 's statement on Clinton 's private email server and anti - Trump texts from a top agent are "" deeply troubling . "" "
0	185	" "" There is extreme bias against this president with high - up members of the team there at the FBI who were investigating Hillary Clinton at the time , "" Gidley charged , as special counsel Robert Mueller pushes on with a probe of possible Trump campaign ties to Russia . "
0	185	 Gidley says Trump maintains confidence in the FBI 's rank - and - file . 
0	185	 Edits to the Comey draft appeared to soften the gravity of the bureau 's finding in its 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton 's use of a private email server while secretary of state . 
0	185	" "" It is very sad when you look at those documents , how they 've done that is really , really disgraceful , and you have a lot of really angry people who are seeing it , "" Trump said of the document . "
0	185	" Gidley said the disclosure of politically charged text messages sent by one of the agents on the Clinton case , Peter Strzok , were "" eye - opening . "" "
0	185	 Strzok , who was in the room as Clinton was interviewed , was later assigned to special counsel Robert Mueller 's team to investigate potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign . 
0	185	 He was re - assigned after the messages were uncovered this summer . 
0	185	 About 200 leaders in law enforcement from around the country attended the weeks - long FBI National Academy program aimed at raising law enforcement standards and cooperation . 
0	185	 Coursework included intelligence theory , terrorism and terrorist mindsets , law , behavioral science , law enforcement communication , and forensic science .Trump blasts FBI leadership but says he 's loyal to police
0	186	"Donald Trump lit a fresh controversy this week with his suggestion that "" Second Amendment people "" could stop Hillary Clinton from naming her judicial picks , if she becomes president - a remark many interpreted as a suggestion that gun rights activists could violently target Clinton or her judicial nominees . "
0	186	" "" "" If she gets to pick her judges , nothing you can do , folks , "" Trump said at a rally on Tuesday . "" "
0	186	 Although the Second Amendment people , maybe there is , I do n't know . 
0	186	" But I 'll tell you what , that will be a horrible day . "" "
0	186	 Trump and his defenders say critics misread the remark . 
0	186	 They insist the GOP nominee was merely talking about Second Amendment supporters peacefully exercising their political power to prevent Clinton from appointing jurists to the federal bench . 
0	186	 And some have pointed to a similar gaffe Clinton made in 2008 to argue that Trump deserves the benefit of the doubt . 
0	186	 As the Democratic nomination was slipping from her grasp in May 2008 , Clinton faced calls to drop out and endorse then - Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , who 'd at that point built a virtually insurmountable lead in the primary . 
0	186	" When she was asked by a South Dakota newspaper at the end of that month why she was still running , Clinton replied , "" You know , my husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June , right ? ... "
0	186	" We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California . "" "
0	186	 To some , Clinton 's response suggested she was staying in the race because there was a possibility Obama could be killed , as Bobby Kennedy had been during the 1968 Democratic primary . 
0	186	" After an indignant eruption from Obama 's team , Clinton quickly backtracked : "" I regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation and in particular the Kennedy family was in any way offensive . "
0	186	" I certainly had no intention of that whatsoever . "" "
0	186	" It was n't quite a pristine mea culpa - she apologized "" if "" her remark was "" in any way offensive , "" not for the remark itself . "
0	186	 But it 's worth noting that she was considerably more contrite than Trump has been in response to his own misstep . 
0	186	 66 Photos Best photos of campaign 2016 
0	186	" "" Give me a break , "" Trump scoffed to Fox News when asked about the criticism . "
0	186	" His campaign released a statement blaming the "" dishonest media "" for manufacturing the controversy . "
0	186	" On May 25 , 2008 , days after Clinton 's remark on RFK , her spokesman , Howard Wolfson , appeared on "" Face the Nation "" to offer the campaign 's version of events . "
0	186	" "" What she clearly said , and what she meant , was that , in previous election cycles -- and she referenced first her husband 's in 1992 , and then 1968 - -we've had campaigns that have gone on into June and actually beyond , "" he said . "" "
0	186	 And so her reference to Senator Kennedy was a historical reference . 
0	186	 The people in the room in South Dakota where she said this at the newspaper found nothing peculiar about it . 
0	186	 She has said this before ; there was no commentary or discussion about it when she 'd said it before . 
0	186	 And I think , unfortunately , her remarks have been blown out of proportion . 
0	186	 She very quickly made clear what she meant . 
0	186	 If she caused anyone any discomfort or pain -- because it is obviously a very sensitive topic -- she apologized . 
0	186	" But she was talking about it in a historical context . "" "
0	186	 Still , Wolfson later added , he did n't believe Clinton owed Obama a personal apology . 
0	186	" "" Her remarks were not about Senator Obama , "" Wolfson explained . "" "
0	186	 They had nothing to do with Senator Obama . 
0	186	" And so , you know , there would be no reason for her to apologize to Senator Obama . ""Why Hillary Clinton might feel Donald Trump 's pain after "" 2nd Amendment "" gaffe"
1	187	I was listening to a Christian radio show awhile back before I was scheduled to go on , and one of the guests before me was talking about the organization he formed to fight back against powerful liberals in the United States and the ideologies they are spending billions of dollars to advance . 
1	187	" This man kept talking about how liberalism is a "" threat "" to Christianity , and how any number of liberal political ideologies are going to somehow damage the faith , though he was n't very specific as to how . "
1	187	" Similarly , I was watching a video the other day in which the Christian missionary called Islam "" the greatest threat to Christianity today . "" "
1	187	 Really ? 
1	187	 A threat to what ? 
1	187	 Make Christianity untrue ? 
1	187	 What Are We So Afraid Of ? 
1	187	 So many American Christians , evangelicals in particular , are paralyzed by fear . 
1	187	" We talk about how political liberalism or Islam are "" threats "" to Christianity and make compelling cases for why our brothers and sisters in Christ should devote time , money and other resources to protect Christianity against these threats . "
1	187	 Christianity is not threatened by modern political liberalism , any strand of Islam ( violent or non - violent ) or any other worldview on the entire planet . 
1	187	" I tweeted last week : "" If you view other religions or worldviews as ‘ threats ' to Christianity , I kind of wonder if you know how the story ends . "" "
1	187	" The idea that something could be a "" threat "" to Christianity implies that , somehow , Christianity could be put on a sort of "" endangered religions "" list , or that Christians could become extinct altogether . "
1	187	 This is a lie fueled by hearts that have made an idol of power and influence . 
1	187	 Christianity , defined by the gospel of Jesus Christ and the implications of that gospel , offers the world what other worldviews can not . 
1	187	 So , Christians who want the best for their communities and the world are right to work for Christianity 's spread around the world . 
1	187	 But , particularly among conservative evangelicals in 21st - century America , there seems to be a feeling that Christianity is at risk of extinction . 
1	187	 This is not the case . 
1	187	 Christianity 's Dominance Is Threatened 
1	187	 Is Christianity at risk of losing its powerful influence over America ? 
1	187	 Yes it is ( most say it already has ) . 
1	187	" Is Christianity at risk of becoming less and less socially acceptable in America and bordering on being considered "" hate "" ? "
1	187	 Yes it is . 
1	187	 For some , these two truths are terrifying and are indicative of the impending demise of Christianity . 
1	187	 Do not believe this lie . 
1	187	 It is right to be concerned for the millions of Christians around the world who are being threatened . 
1	187	 This is a reality about which we should be praying regularly . 
1	187	" But "" threatened Christians "" do not make a "" threatened Christianity . "" "
1	187	 Christianity 's existence and well - being is not dependent on how widespread it is accepted in America or the world . 
1	187	 Christianity is dependent on the finished work of Christ . 
1	187	 Period . 
1	187	" This means nothing is a "" threat "" to Christianity . "
1	187	 Plenty of forces — worldviews , political ideologies and more — threaten Christianity 's dominance in America . 
1	187	 For some , Christianity 's dominance in America and the Western world is what legitimizes it . 
1	187	 It is these people who believe Christianity is threatened . 
1	187	 Because it 's true — Christian dominance in America and the West is being overshadowed by other worldviews . 
1	187	 Praise God that the Christian faith is not dependent on its 21st - century cultural dominance , but by the dominion of its eternal , glorious God . 
1	187	 When you claim that ISIS or the Democrats or whomever else is threatening Christianity , you spit in the face of the God who conquered sin and death because you 're afraid he ca n't conquer competing worldviews . 
1	187	 Christianity does n't have to be the most popular worldview in America to be the right one . 
1	187	" Sometimes I think American evangelicals push for the widespread acceptance of Christianity because they want to be "" right "" more than they want the world to flourish in the grace of God . "
1	187	 No terrorist attack , peaceful mosque or Supreme Court justice can knock down the house whose cornerstone is Christ . 
1	187	 But it will demolish the house whose cornerstone is cultural favor . 
1	187	" Romans 8:35 says , "" Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? "
1	187	" Shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or danger , or sword ? "" "
1	187	 Or liberals , or ISIS , or Supreme Court Justices , or car bombs ? 
1	187	 The foundation of our faith is seated on the throne because his work is finished . 
1	187	 He 's not concerned . 
1	187	 Why should we be ?

1	191	 Gupta Patel Slams New Bill Passed To Teach Your Kids Anal Sex In Public School And He 's Fired Up Like A Samosa Fresh Out The Pan !

1	191	 Email us at [ email protected ] for more information . 
1	191	 Everyone knows and loves Gupta Patel - Turtleboy 's crazy Indian Tech Guy and proud convenience store proprietor . 
1	191	 He 's never blogged for us before but something caught his eye in the news that sent him reeling . 
1	191	 Let 's give him a warm welcome as he has a meltdown about the statehouse deciding to teach kids as young as 12 how to safely take it in the back door ! 
1	191	 Your uncle Gupta read this one news article last night and choke on his Vodka Slushee ! 
1	191	 Last Thursday , the Massachusetts Senate passed new sex education package by a 31 - 6 vote in favor . 
1	191	 Look like the usual chutiyas in the statehouse been drinking the same strange flavor KoolAid again . 
1	191	 Take a look at this nutty - ass booshit : 
1	191	 From New Boston Post— As it did in 2015 , the Massachusetts Senate passed a bill nearly 
1	191	 entirely along party lines on Thursday dictating how school districts teach sex education ; and just like two years ago , the biggest sticking point for the bill 's opponents was the lack of an opt - in stipulation for parents and guardians . 
1	191	 Unlike in 2015 , however , it is likely this version of the bill will reach the House floor for a vote , but it remains to be seen if lawmakers on the other side of the State House attach the failed parental opt - in amendment touted Thursday by House Minority Leader Bruce Tarr ( R - Gloucester ) . 
1	191	" Following the 31 - 6 vote in favor that saw the only Democratic opposition come from state Senator Michael Rush of West Roxbury , Tarr praised the "" robust and healthy debate "" that transpired Thursday afternoon but expressed "" hope that as it makes its way through the legislative process "" that lawmakers outside the Senate will wind up adopting proposals like a parental consent stipulation . "
1	191	 The bill 's lead sponsor , state Senator Sal DiDomenico ( D - Everett ) took issue with Tarr 's opt - in proposal . 
1	191	" "" This amendment would gut the bill , "" DiDomenico claimed , noting that the legislation already features an opt - out amendment for both parents and school districts . "" "
1	191	 This amendment would effectively take all the work we put together and throw it out the window . 
1	191	" "" We do not have opt - in for science , math , English — we do n't have any opt - in initiative for any other subjects in our schools — this subject in particular could save lives . "" "
1	191	 Other Democrats who spoke out in opposition to Tarr 's amendment included state Senator John Keenan of Quincy , Worcester 's Harriet Chandler , and Boston 's Sonia Chang - Diaz . 
1	191	" Keenan and Chang - Diaz added that a parental consent requirement would add an unnecessary level of bureaucracy , with Keenan claiming that it "" would require school districts to chase down the parents of every single student "" while Chang - Diaz noting that "" many of my colleagues in the chamber in the minority are avid proponents of small streamlined government . "" "
1	191	" Chandler claimed that an opt - in provision would result in a "" very limited number of people who would be taking advantage of it . "" "
1	191	" "" The alternative of what we 're talking about is our children learning about these behaviors from what they hear on the school bus or read on the Internet , "" she added . "
1	191	 State Senator Vinny deMacedo ( R - Plymouth ) , responding to Keenan 's point , used student field trips as an example of opt - in protocol . 
1	191	" "" I do n't think that 's an impossible hurdle to overcome , "" he said . "" "
1	191	" The reality is that asking parents if they 're comfortable with this or not is not a stretch by any means . "" "
1	191	 Tarr appeared to take issue with the claim linking parental approval to an added layer of bureaucracy . 
1	191	" "" Well well well , it is interesting that some of these folks have stood at this microphone and suggested somehow that obtaining parental consent is so burdensome that we should n't follow through with this , "" Tarr quipped . "" "
1	191	" Suggesting that the role of a parent should be subordinate to the role of bureaucracy , now that 's a deeply concerning thought . "" "
1	191	" Tarr also challenged DiDomenico 's claim that an opt - in provision would "" gut the bill . "" "
1	191	" "" That somehow this bill is jeopardized by the fact that we might want to involve parents in the decision making — what does that suggest about the priorities of the bill ? "" "
1	191	" Tarr questioned . "" "
1	191	 It suggests that somehow we ought to subordinate the role of the parent to the role of the state . 
1	191	" "" It 's also been suggested that we do n't have opt - in provisions for math , science , and other things , well that is true , but we also do n't have opt - out provisions for those things , because they do n't fit the same matter as the subject matter that we 're discussing here . "" "
1	191	 Conservative organizations , including the Massachusetts Family Institute , are vehemently opposed to the bill over the proposed curriculum 's subject matter , which suggests that instruction regarding sexual aspects such as anal intercourse is age - appropriate for children as young as 12.Some of the instructional material approved by state education officials was created by Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts . 
1	191	" "" If you have to have an affirmative act from a parent in order to go on a school trip , should you not have to have the affirmative act of a parent to be involved in education that involves morality , subjective judgment , and important health matters ? "" "
1	191	" Tarr said . "" "
1	191	" I think the matter speaks for itself . "" "
1	191	" DiDomenico responded to Tarr 's argument by noting he is not looking to subvert the role of parents and countered that he "" would put this in the same category as English , math , and science . "" "
1	191	" "" In some respects I 'd put it ahead of those subjects , "" DiDomenico added . "" "
1	191	" There are life - ending , life - long consequences , and a critical mistake can change their lives forever . "" "
1	191	 State Senator Barbara L'Italien ( D - Andover ) also spoke , mentioning an incident in which her older sister became pregnant during high school . 
1	191	" "" Getting married at age 17 locked her into a life of virtual poverty , "" L'Italien said . "" "
1	191	 I wish there had been accurate health information when she was a student back in the ' 70s , I think her life might have changed dramatically . 
1	191	" "" There are times when government needs to be proactive , and protective , and this is one of those situations . "" "
1	191	 Sweet Baby Vishnu ! 
1	191	 The anal sex education is age appropriate for 12 year old ? 
1	191	 What fucking version of goddamn Kama Sutra they been reading ? 
1	191	 The Paul Georgio translation ? 
1	191	 This Hindu had the very very bad nightmares after reading this news ! 
1	191	 In my dream , my daughter , Gupta Jr , was back in the grade school . 
1	191	" I was watching my favorite American movie "" Mansion of Blood "" and Mindy Robinson was just about to show all the peoples her hot hot Samosas when my daughter come running through the door , She say "" Papa ! "
1	191	 Papa ! 
1	191	" I have the question about the sex ! "" "
1	191	" And I say "" Yes my little one , I have been preparing for this conversation long time . "
1	191	" Ask your papa your questions "" . "
1	191	" She say "" Papa , when will it stop hurting my ass so much ? "" "
1	191	 Your old Uncle Gupta almost had the bad heart attacks ! 
1	191	" "" As it did in 2015 , the Massachusetts Senate passed a bill nearly entirely along party lines on Thursday dictating how school districts teach sex education ; and just like two years ago , the biggest sticking point for the bill 's opponents was the lack of an opt - in stipulation for parents and guardians . "" "
1	191	 Really ? 
1	191	 Uncle Gupta think the biggest sticking point probably gon na be the anal sex . 
1	191	 Seriously though . 
1	191	 You can opt out of goddamn Pledge of Allegiance in school in Massachusetts without facing the punishments , but you ca n't opt out of learning how to send your pork soldier to the battle in Brownsville ? 
1	191	" "" The bill 's lead sponsor , state Senator Sal DiDomenico ( D - Everett ) took issue with Tarr 's opt - in proposal . "
1	191	" "" This amendment would gut the bill , "" DiDomenico claimed , noting that the legislation already features an opt - out amendment for both parents and school districts . "" "
1	191	 This amendment would effectively take all the work we put together and throw it out the window . 
1	191	" "" We do not have opt - in for science , math , English — we do n't have any opt - in initiative for any other subjects in our schools — this subject in particular could save lives . "" "
1	191	" Ganesha , please take me now , These chutiyas gon na drive this humble Hindu to carnivorism . "" "
1	191	" Johnny , study the maths and the science good so you can be great physicist someday ! "" "" "
1	191	 Susie ! 
1	191	" finish your English homeworks so you can be excellent writer someday . "" "
1	191	 Mary ! 
1	191	" Make sure you do n't miss any of the Massachusetts mandated sex education class so you can be great wide receiver some day ! "" "
1	191	 In the name of heavenly teacher Guru Deva please reincarnate these people as pimples on Kim Kardashian 's face at bukake session after Black Lives Matter rally . 
1	191	 State Senator Barbara L'Italien ( D - Andover ) also spoke , mentioning an incident in which her older sister became pregnant during high school . 
1	191	" "" Getting married at age 17 locked her into a life of virtual poverty , "" L'Italien said . "" "
1	191	 I wish there had been accurate health information when she was a student back in the ' 70s , I think her life might have changed dramatically . 
1	191	 Ms. Barbarabhen ! 
1	191	" Did you really just say "" Damn , my sister 's life would be so much better now if only she had taken the rusty trombone in her swamp starfish that one time instead of in her hoo - ha . "" ? ? "
1	191	 It Take one real classy lady to say she wishes her niece or nephew had taken a wrong turn down Willy Wonka 's garbage chute . 
1	191	 Uncle Gupta do n't think it 's too strange that Barbara L'Italien advocating for taking it from the behind . 
1	191	 Nobody gon na want to be looking at this in the face during the hot nookie - nookie session .. 
1	191	 Holy mother of Kali ! 
1	191	 Blowjob from this one probably count as anal anyways . 
1	191	 No surprise here really . 
1	191	 Both L'Italien and Chandler recently vote to give themselves fat pay hike , so they have lot of experience stuffing the pepperonis in the peoples hot pockets . 
1	191	 This one Hindu here do n't know about you , but when I see Hariette Chandler 's face , the first thing that come to mind not going to be anal sex : 
1	191	 Sweet baby Hannuman ! 
1	191	 Her ass probably look like dying Yoda 's forehead . 
1	191	 Going to work up her Lincoln Log Factory probably sound like punching a fist into the open jar of Miracle Whip ! ( 
1	191	 Miracle Whip ! 
1	191	 Two jars for five dollar at my Main South Happy Hindu Mart Convenience Store in Worcester . 
1	191	 Next five minute only . ) 
1	191	 She so old her dunghole probably look like the hopper on a meat grinder after Porketta night . 
1	191	 This one Sonia Chang - Diaz though ? 
1	191	 Would . 
1	191	 This Hindu just saying . 
1	191	" "" There are times when government needs to be proactive , and protective , and this is one of those situations . "" "
1	191	 I agreeing that government should be protective and proactive . 
1	191	 Maybe if they had voted to give the Police the Kevlar Vests instead of giving their fat samosa asses big raise it would have been good start . 
1	191	 Educating the 12 years old child about anal sex ? 
1	191	 Not so much . 
1	191	 You know what going to happen in the class full of 12 years old kids when teacher start talking about the anal and oral sex ? 
1	191	 Gon na be like comedy scene in bad Hindi movie . 
1	191	" Maybe not during class , but afterwards they gon na make the fun . "" "
1	191	 Rectum ? 
1	191	" Damn near killed him ! "" "
1	191	 joke gon na get old real quick in the cafeteria . 
1	191	" State Legislators are calling this bill the "" Healthy Youth Act "" . "
1	191	 That really nice way of putting it . 
1	191	" As usual with these "" Dheela Lund Ni Olaad "" ( That my Gujarati language for "" Sons of the broken penis "" ) , the devil is in the details … and Uncle Gupta all about the details ! "
1	191	" One of the textbooks approved in the bill is called "" Get Real : Comprehensive Sex Education That Works , "" put out by the Planned Parenthood . "
1	191	 Book is only available in bundles of 50 , and this thrifty Indian man not buying if he ca n't find the coupon or get the good deal . 
1	191	 I ferret couple passages out on the internets for you . 
1	191	 You 're welcome . 
1	191	" One lesson teaches the childrens that A dental dam is "" placed over the vulva or anus during oral sex "" . "
1	191	" Then it goes on to say the people can also use the "" Non - Microwaveable Saran Wrap "" . "
1	191	" Papa Gupta spend most of his daughter 's pre - teen years yelling at her to do the healthy things . "" "
1	191	 Do n't touch that ! 
1	191	 Do not step in the dog mess ! 
1	191	 Do n't put the statue of Baby Krishna in your mouth ! 
1	191	 Wash Your hands before eating ! 
1	191	" Use the Purell after shaking Senator McGovern 's hand ! "" . "
1	191	 Now , she would have to go to school next day and learn how to toss the big salad ? ? 
1	191	 It 's ok though … . 
1	191	 Happy Hindu Mart sell plenty of non - microwaveable Saran Wrap . 
1	191	 This handsome Indian TurtleBoy do n't think Saran Wrap company be too happy knowing sex education class teaching the children to use their product to cover the chocolate cannoli . 
1	191	" Another lesson talk about using the "" internal condom that is inserted into the anus . "" "
1	191	" They say it acts as a barrier but warns that "" it may slip out of place during vaginal or anal intercourse and may be difficult to insert . "" "
1	191	 Wait … what you say ? 
1	191	 I had to call my cousin the Gastroenterologist about this one . 
1	191	 Dr. Dharmendra Tubupyeresh . 
1	191	" I say "" Hey , Dharmendra , you ever hear of such thing ? "" "
1	191	" He say to me "" Gupta , you been lighting up the porn hub again ? "
1	191	" Yes there is such the thing . "" "
1	191	 He send me over this picture . 
1	191	" "" Insert two fingers inside the condom and gently push it into the anal cavity . "
1	191	" The inner ring can be removed after inserted if desired . "" "
1	191	 Lovely . 
1	191	 12 year old gon na learn how to shove the ziplock bag up the friend 's wazoo before doing the zoom - zoom in the boom - boom . 
1	191	 When Uncle Gupta first read this news , he knew something smell funny … and not just the anal sex ! 
1	191	 Then this bald prick rears his ugly head and everything make sense … 
1	191	 Senator Jamie Eldridge . 
1	191	 You might remember him from such blogs as these . 
1	191	 This bhenchod one real professional turtle poking man ! 
1	191	 In my former country he would not have been problem because we would have already kill him already . 
1	191	 Notice how he do n't tweet about the content of the bill … only that the Mass Senate GOP ( all six of them ) oppose it . 
1	191	 Let me tell you something , Senator Jamie … nobody going to oppose young adults learning the safe ways to make the sweet nookie - nookie , but not letting parents opt them out ? 
1	191	 What kind of glass dinka - doodle you been smoking from ? 
1	191	 This Hindu gets it . 
1	191	 Too many kids having the sex at young age … Definitely should be options available to teach healthy sexual practices to children , but if any citizen ever texted the contents of some of these lessons to a child , they would go to the prison . 
1	191	 And we all know what happen in prison . 
1	191	 Dunghole come out looking like Saarlac sand monster from the Return of the Jedi . 
1	191	 Anyway , this Hindu try hard to reach these senators on Twitter but they not responding . 
1	191	 Wonder why .

1	193	 What started as a refusal to accept the results of a democratically held election has turned into Kathy Griffin doing her best ISIS impression on the president of our country .  
1	193	 This past weekend , I took a camping trip with my dad and older brother . 
1	193	 We sat around a camp fire drinking beers , talking politics , reminiscing , and acting like a couple of teenage boys degenerating into far lower forms of conversation . 
1	193	 There were no kids , no wives , and no distractions — male bonding at its finest . 
1	193	 It was everything I needed in a break from the daily grind of having to be the guy who deals with people beating , stabbing , shooting , stealing from , and lying about each other for a living . 
1	193	 It 's the youngest I 've seen the old man look , the most laid back I 've seen my brother act , and the most humbled I 've felt in years . 
1	193	 I 'm glad we did it . 
1	193	 I do n't get to see my old man very often anymore since I moved across the country , and I almost forgot how hilarious he can be . 
1	193	 As a retired cop himself , he 's able to bounce back and forth between sidesplittingly entertaining stories and philosophical and profound ones before bringing it back around and making you laugh all over again . 
1	193	 It 's the type of unique style that can only develop in a man who has put in 26 years on the job and lived to tell about it . 
1	193	 I could go on all day about the tales told , laughs had , and lessons learned , but there 's one story in particular that is sticking out in my mind today now that the image of Kathy Griffin holding up the severed head of our president has broken the internet . 
1	193	 One of the main reasons Pop 's stories have so much depth and detail is because he patrolled the streets of the same city as an adult that he once called his stomping grounds as a kid . 
1	193	 It was n't uncommon for some of the most ridiculous people he 'd dealt with as a cop to have been his friends or schoolmates at one point in time . 
1	193	 A shining example of this was the time my old man found himself wrapped up in a childhood acquaintance 's plot to assassinate President Reagan . 
1	193	 One fateful night , Joe Blow had two or ten drinks too many and sat himself down behind the wheel of a car that ultimately paved his way straight to a jail cell on a DUI . 
1	193	 My dad , along with a few other local boys turned cops , knew Blow growing up , and their names started getting thrown around by the drunken clown as soon as he parked his butt in the drunk tank to dry out . 
1	193	 Drunks are pure entertainment for cops up until the point where they get in the way of us going home on time . 
1	193	 It 's not unusual for their ranting and raving to lead to demanding things like water , trips to the restroom , phone calls , and all kinds of other earthly desires , as was the case with Blow . 
1	193	 Eventually , the ridiculous behavior and name - dropping piqued someone 's interest enough to call Lefever and find out what he knew about this guy . 
1	193	 No compatible source was found for this video . 
1	193	 By the time Pop answered the phone in the middle of the night , his buddies are down at the precinct having a good old time laughing and joking at the expense of an individual who was obviously making a fool of himself . 
1	193	 Instead of asking nicely for a cup of water or to use the restroom , Blow had been calling these guys every name in the book and telling them they had better do as he says . 
1	193	 In the same way you do n't give into the demands of a child throwing a temper tantrum , the officers are giving him what he deserves — absolutely nothing . 
1	193	" Eventually , Blow makes his big mistake when he shrieks , "" Well if you do n't give me a glass of water , I 'm gon na kill President Reagan ! "" "
1	193	 To this day , Pop does n't know who put pen to paper , but the Secret Service found out about Blow 's empty threats to assassinate the president over a glass of water that he had nothing to do with two states away . 
1	193	 Blow 's drunken rampage went down early on in Reagan 's first term , and the prez made at least three trips to Jersey in the following eight years . 
1	193	 Blow was put on lockdown each time for the duration of the visit . 
1	193	 Years later , my dad had a Curb Your Enthusiasm moment with the guy at a high school reunion because Blow held him responsible for his place on a Secret Service watch list for almost a decade . 
1	193	 You play stupid games and you win stupid prizes , they say . 
1	193	 I 'm guessing Dutch did n't get his vote in the second term . 
1	193	 All joking aside , four presidents have been assassinated while holding office , and an additional fourteen have survived actual attempts or failed plots on their lives . 
1	193	 Make no mistake about it — the threat is as grave or worse for President Trump as it has been for any president to ever sit in the Oval Office . 
1	193	 Despite the fact that Trump 's name is not included on Wikipedia 's list of US presidential assassination attempts and plots , I 'd argue that he 's facing greater danger than many of the former presidents inhabiting the list ever were . 
1	193	 Just look at the ever - escalating flirtation with Trump death threats made by celebrities . 
1	193	" My earliest memory of this was Pitbull shouting to Trump , "" Watch out for El Chapo , Dude ! "" "
1	193	 after ripping him at the Univision Awards . 
1	193	" A short time later , we had Eminem rapping "" I do n't rap for dead presidents , I 'd rather see the president dead "" in his song "" We as Americans . "" "
1	193	 Then , there was Snoop Dogg holding a gun to a clown depicted to be Trump and pulling the trigger in his music video for Lavender . 
1	193	 Who can forget about Bow Wow 's Twitter rant threatening to pimp the First Lady or Sarah Silverman 's call for the US military to get rid of Trump ? 
1	193	 While it is no secret that publicity - starved and emotionally stunted Hollywood types have a time - honored tradition of one - upmanship and grandstanding to the point of absurdity , fantasizing over Trump 's death went too far the moment they declared it in vogue . 
1	193	 What started as a refusal to accept the results of a democratically held election has turned into Kathy Griffin doing her best ISIS impression on the president of our country . 
1	193	 The worst part about the whole thing is that most people blamed the beheading stunt on Carrot Top . 
1	193	 As a cop , I 'm an expert witness — but I can see how many have been fooled . 
1	193	 Therefore I 've created this meme to show the American people that Carrot Top has been wrongfully accused . 
1	193	" I hate to use the word "" normalize "" in the same way I hate to use the word "" problematic , "" because both come almost exclusively out of the mouths of social justice warrior liberals who believe the guy who invented white chocolate is racist . "
1	193	 In this case , however , I 'll go ahead and do it . 
1	193	 The way in which the killing of President Trump is being normalized is reckless and inexcusable . 
1	193	" Speaking of reckless and inexcusable — lest we forget who lit the torch for the 2017 Trump Assassination Olympics just in time for the inauguration back in January , it was none other than CNN , who ran a segment captioned "" Disaster Could Put Obama Cabinet Member in Oval Office . "" "
1	193	 Calling a network that muses of a newly elected president and his inner circle being murdered the Clinton News Network or Crap News Network just does n't suffice here . 
1	193	 I prefer the Caliphate News Network . 
1	193	 After all , it is CNN who has been allowing Kathy Griffin to host their coverage of New Year 's Eve in Times Square since 2013 . 
1	193	 Will they separate themselves this year , or will the 11 people tuning in be seeing the ball drop replaced with President Trump 's dismembered head falling from his body ? 
1	193	 While the Secret Service has already opened investigations on some of the celebrities I mentioned above without going so far as to put them on a watch list , many people are calling for Kathy Griffin to be locked up . 
1	193	 If Joe Blow can be placed on a watch list for eight years for his drunken rant against Reagan , I 'm all for Griffin , Snoop , Bow Wow , Eminem , Pitbull , Silverman , and the entire CNN production team responsible for the assassination segment getting scooped up and placed under supervision anytime Trump comes to town . 
1	193	 May he do us all a favor and come to town often .As Kathy Griffin Joins ISIS , the US Must Enforce Laws Regarding Threats to the President
1	194	"During the 1950s "" Red Scare , "" innocent Americans were smeared and sometimes blacklisted for being supposed Communists . "
1	194	 Real subversives existed , including Alger Hiss , a traitor and Soviet spy whom liberals - to their misfortune - made into a poster boy of McCarthyism . 
1	194	 But the actual number of Communists was tiny and utterly not commensurate with the fervent public witch hunt led by right - wingers . 
1	194	 Today 's group hysteria comes from the left , as a fanatic political mob sees racists behind every door . 
1	194	 Their paranoia is not harmless , as they use the racist bogeyman to intimidate political adversaries - and sometimes erstwhile friends - while seeking to silence political dialogue . 
1	194	 As with the Red Scare , there 's some reason for vigilance regarding actual racists , as Charlottesville reminded us . 
1	194	 But as with the hunt for Communists under every bed , the scare tactics far outweigh the actual problem . 
1	194	" The New McCarthyism revealed its full absurdity this week via the ACLU 's Twitter stream , which had the temerity to post a picture of an adorable young toddler holding an American flag and a doll with the tag line "" This is the future that ACLU members want . "" "
1	194	 Because the girl ( TRIGGER WARNING : I assume it 's a girl , given the doll ) happens to be blonde and Caucasian , the ACLU was promptly attacked - the ACLU ! 
1	194	" Immediately the politically correct rage mob commenced a digital protest led by credentialed injustice professionals such as Professor Nyasha Junior of Temple University who posted , "" A white kid with a flag ? ! "" "
1	194	 Yes , Professor . 
1	194	 In much of America outside of your faculty lounge , young American children waving Old Glory warms the heart and makes us smile rather than prompt thoughts of white supremacy lurking under the sheets . 
1	194	 Did the ACLU , a group once known for taking brave and unpopular stands , hold its ground or , better yet , simply ignore the online rabble ? 
1	194	 Sadly , no . 
1	194	" The organization shortly responded with a Kermit the Frog image saying "" That 's a very good point "" and the post "" When your followers keep you in check and remind you that white supremacy is everywhere . "" "
1	194	 Come again ? 
1	194	" This lovely young kid holding a flag equals "" white supremacy "" ? "
1	194	 Who even thinks of such things ? 
1	194	 Answer : the diversity hustlers . 
1	194	 Shame on the ACLU , which apparently should have posted a picture of a gender - fluid dark - skinned child , holding a rainbow flag , perhaps with a COEXIST sticker on [ gender - neutral pronoun ] wheelchair . 
1	194	 This is not merely social - media silliness . 
1	194	 It 's not even lunacy , although it certainly seems insane . 
1	194	 This is a weapon used cynically and viciously -- little girls are apparently acceptable collateral damage -- by the left to isolate and demonize opponents , and particularly President Trump and his supporters . 
1	194	" As MSNBC 's Donny Deutsch said of Trump : "" He is a racist -- can we just say it once and for all ? "" "
1	194	 Such accusations are not rare . 
1	194	 If I had a dollar for every time the mainstream media accused Trump and his voters of racism , I 'd be about as rich as the recent Powerball winner . 
1	194	 As a Hispanic , I believe that people of color , for far too long , have been taken for granted by the Democratic Party . 
1	194	 I also believe that the Trump movement represents real policy solutions for the woes of poverty and violence that burden too many African - American and Latino citizens . 
1	194	 But the digital rage mob holds people like me in particular contempt , as I saw during the 2016 campaign in the form of a constant stream of online slurs . 
1	194	" Yes , today 's liberals are quick to use racism 's terms when it suits their purposes , calling me a "" coconut "" ( brown on the outside , white on the inside ) and "" Tio Tomas "" ( Uncle Tom in Spanish ) . "
1	194	 One of the main reasons America has succeeded as a country lies is our rejection of the tribalism that afflicts and paralyzes so much of the world . 
1	194	 America is an idea , and one open to all who embrace it , regardless of skin color , heritage , or religion . 
1	194	 To be sure , America must own the racist sins of our history . 
1	194	 Thankfully , such systemic racism is just that , history - as evidenced by electing twice to our highest office an African - American man with a decidedly un - European name . 
1	194	 Instead of allowing a new scourge , this Racist Scare , to corrode our discourse , we must embrace our common American identity , rooted in our best traditions and elucidated in our founding documents . 
1	194	 We should be difficult to offend and slow to accuse others of the disease of prejudice . 
1	194	" As the incumbent president of the United States explained in his inaugural address seven months ago : "" When you open your heart to patriotism , there is no room for bigotry . "" "
1	194	 Amen .

1	196	 I had two liberal colleagues at the CIA who believed in global warming and neither had any proof to justify their opinions .  
1	196	 By Joe Boatwright : 
1	196	 I 'm amazed that there is still an argument surrounding global warming . 
1	196	 Most of the literature is full of articles from organizations that deal with planetary weather issues or other political organizations that have joined the climate change movement . 
1	196	 Conclusively , none of any of their global warming predictions have come to fruition . 
1	196	 Almost every assertion has been debunked or proven false , sometimes by other parts of the same organization ! 
1	196	 Why should conservatives continue to debate liberals on this topic ? 
1	196	 Firstly , conservatives should always try to stop any insanity from the left , no matter what the subject . 
1	196	 Secondly , the left continues to put forth their agenda on global warming , no matter how idiotic . 
1	196	 So unfortunately , the right must respond against these arguments ( again , no matter how absurd ) . 
1	196	" Rush Limbaugh agreed by positing another reason : "" The only reason we 're even talking about global warming — well , the real only reason — is its part of the left 's agenda of expanding government worldwide , raising taxes worldwide , and a key ingredient of this is blaming average citizens for the problem . "" "
1	196	 The conservative fight is to keep the left 's ‘ one world order ' and worldwide tax increases from happening . 
1	196	 We should not allow them to blame anyone for something that does not exist and ca n't be proven . 
1	196	" Back in August 2014 Alex Newman wrote in The New American , "" Embarrassing Predictions Haunt the Global - Warming Industry . "" "
1	196	 This excellent article details in length the litany of failed global warming predictions . 
1	196	 It also criticizes organizations like the UN that recanted some of their farcical claims , sometimes even before they could be proven wrong . 
1	196	 In one instance , the UN discovered their ‘ scientific ' evidence came from the World Wildlife Fund propaganda literature . 
1	196	 The claims from the liberal agenda of these organizations are so outlandish that it would n't be surprising for them to throw in some type of zombie apocalypse . 
1	196	 Global Warming is not scientific ; it has become a political issue with many commenters who act as experts . 
1	196	 In addition , articles that have been debunked continue to be echoed in other commentaries . 
1	196	 These commentaries continue to make further inane assertions based on information already proven wrong . 
1	196	 Global warming theorists who act as though this information is the word of God have taken the definition of non - sequitur to another level . 
1	196	" Neuman points this out : "" the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) has acted as the main scaremonger for the global warming lobby that led to the Kyoto Protocol . "" "
1	196	" However , "" the IPCC is a political , not scientific , body . "" "
1	196	 Only liberal extremists still beat the global warming drum — you should n't be listening . 
1	196	 No compatible source was found for this video . 
1	196	 However , global warming myths continue to circulate periodically , despite being dispelled at length . 
1	196	 For instance , there is the worry of our ecosystems being disrupted by rising temperatures or increasing CO2 . 
1	196	 Numerous studies show that there is no proof of rising temperatures distinct from natural system variations , and atmospheric CO2 is a beneficial fertilizer for plants ! 
1	196	 Regardless of the causes of these variations , the planet 's ecosystems have been adapting since the beginning of time . 
1	196	 Almost as an urban legend , abnormal ice melting claims about both the north and south pole regions continue . 
1	196	 But the only thing that is abnormal is that anyone believes them . 
1	196	 I had two liberal colleagues at the CIA who believed in global warming and neither had any proof to justify their opinions . 
1	196	 One had just experienced a hurricane and said that he would crush anyone 's head who was a non - believer in global warming . 
1	196	 He was later fired , not because of his global warming beliefs , but because of his poor analytical skills . 
1	196	 Our very liberal office allowed the other colleague to show slides from a vacation trip to the Arctic Circle . 
1	196	 In addition , an alleged diminishing local animal population was presented as further proof . 
1	196	 Of course , no real proof was presented . 
1	196	 As one of the senior analysts of the office , I took no real part in the discussions . 
1	196	" Office politics aside , I took to heart Mark Twain 's saying , "" never argue with a fool ; onlookers may not be able to tell the difference . "" "
1	196	 However , in their defense , they never professed to be experts — they were just more misguided liberals ( is that redundant ? ) 
1	196	 who are plentiful everywhere including the intelligence agencies . 
1	196	 How can you argue with the so - called global warming experts that use the inanest ‘ evidence ' and arguments to support their claims ? 
1	196	 For instance , it is amazing how many ‘ experts ' use fictional movies about global warming to support their claims ! 
1	196	 If Al Gore gives up on Global Warming , he should move on to vampires , werewolves , and zombies . 
1	196	 There are plenty of movies with that type of scientific evidence ! 
1	196	 I 'm surprised that people are n't curious why there are no other climate claims other than global warming . 
1	196	 For example , what happened to concerns about oceans . 
1	196	 Seriously , decades ago severe pollution and rising sea levels was as big of a concern as global warming . 
1	196	 I read that there was a swordfish in the Smithsonian that was over 150 years old , and that a group of global warming advocates would have conclusive proof of the effects of industrial man if the tissue in the swordfish was significantly different from fish of today . 
1	196	 However , examination showed that it was n't . 
1	196	 Thus , they had to go back to their old theory of rising oceans , which of course , ca n't be proven either . 
1	196	 When I was living in the D.C. area , one of the stations was particularly proud of their new Doppler radar that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars . 
1	196	 They touted that it could predict snow arrival , as well as depth . 
1	196	 As a former Army air defender with a knowledge of this radar , I did n't think they fully understood its capabilities or value . 
1	196	 The other stations predicted the weather just as well without the radar , one station even used an old wooden yardstick to show the depth of the snow . 
1	196	 Their depth measured the exact same as the station with the Doppler . 
1	196	 Some cynics believe accuracy was never the goal in any global warming forecasts anyway ; the goal was always to gain more money , power , and influence . 
1	196	" I agree with other rational , logical ‘ climate deniers ' that "" the Earth 's climate has always changed , and very likely will continue to change , regardless of what humans do . "
1	196	" What is now clear , though , is that the establishment has no idea what those changes will be — much less what drives the changes or how to control them . "" "
1	196	 However , does it really matter to a liberal what the truth is ? 
1	196	 They control almost all of the main stream media , which in turn presents their propaganda . 
1	196	 It is shamefully evident why there are so few conservative messages from the media . 
1	196	 If the left are so correct , should n't they still compare and contrast their opinion with others to prove their point ?Global Warming … Enough Already
0	197	Former President Barack Obama has reportedly been called to serve jury duty next month , according to The Chicago Tribune .

0	197	" His safety will be uppermost in our minds . "" "
0	197	 Last week , Obama joined forces with the four other living former United States presidents to host a relief concert to aid victims of Hurricanes Harvey , Irma , and Maria . 
0	197	" The event , "" Deep From the Heart : The One America Appeal , "" was held at Texas A&M and featured performances by Sam Moore , Yolanda Evans , Lyle Lovett and a special guest appearance from Lady Gaga — and it apparently also featured a little comedy from George W. Bush . "

1	199	"The State Department argued at a federal hearing Thursday that its ability to process the 100,000 Hillary Clinton emails ordered released under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit has been hindered by a lack of manpower due to a "" hiring freeze "" and that the urgency to release the documents has been diminished by the public 's lack of interest in the subject , according to the watchdog group that won the lawsuit for the document 's release . "
1	199	 But Judicial Watch , a conservative watchdog group that sued the State Department in May 2015 for the thousands of emails and documents , is n't buying it . 
1	199	" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton is accusing the State Department of slow - rolling the emails being sent from the FBI to the State Department , a large number of which Clinton "" failed to disclose "" to the government when she served as secretary of state , he said . "
1	199	 On July 15 , the FBI allegedly turned over to the State Department a new disk of emails belonging to former Clinton aide Huma Abedin . 
1	199	 The emails were apparently discovered on a laptop owned by Abedin 's estranged husband , Anthony Weiner . 
1	199	 Weiner pleaded guilty in May to sending a number of text messages and sexually explicit pictures last year to a 15-year - old girl in North Carolina . 
1	199	" There apparently are 7,000 emails from Abedin on Weiner 's laptop , said Fitton , who added that State Department and Justice Department lawyers are "" claiming they have to appraise them , whether they are personal or government , and then sift through what can be shared publicly . "" "
1	199	" State Department spokeswoman Pooja Jhunjhunwala told Circa "" ‎the Department takes its records management responsibilities seriously and is working diligently to process FOIA requests and to balance the demands of the many requests we have received . "" "" "
1	199	" We are devoting significant resources to meeting our litigation obligations , "" she added . "
1	199	" The State Department was ordered in November to process documents at the rate of 500 pages per month , but "" at that rate it would take until 2020 for the bulk to made public , "" Fitton said . "
1	199	 So far , the State Department has produced 17 batches of documents , Fitton said . 
1	199	" "" President Trump needs to direct his agencies to follow the the law but right now they are making a mockery of it by saying they wo n't finish releasing it until 2020 , "" said Fitton , whose group will be heading back to court three months from now to assess the progress . "" "
1	199	 I can understand the president 's frustration because he wanted these made public . 
1	199	" However , his Justice and State departments are making excuses of why they have to slow - roll it this way . "" "
1	199	 Trump has made numerous assertions about Clinton and her email server . 
1	199	" In June , he tweeted that Clinton destroyed her phones and "" bleached "" her emails . "
1	199	" But the president 's own Justice Department civil attorneys argued Thursday that there was "" diminished public interest "" in the emails . "
1	199	" A U.S. official familiar with the case and the agencies told Circa on the condition that they not be named that "" there are still holdovers within the departments that do n't want to see these emails released , so slow - rolling these requests makes perfect sense . "
1	199	" If the president wants these emails released then he will have to demand that the agencies abide . "" "
1	199	" Last week , Judicial Watch released 448 pages of documents the State Department did turn over from Abedin , describing what it said was preferential treatment "" to major donors to the Clinton Foundation and political campaigns , "" according to the group . "
1	199	" "" The documents included six Clinton email exchanges not previously turned over to the State Department , bringing the known total to date to at least 439 emails that were not part of the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department , and further contradicting a statement by Clinton that , ' as far as she knew , ' all of her government emails had been turned over to the State Department , "" the watchdog group stated in a July 14 press release .The State Department said there 's less urgency to release Clinton 's emails due to low interest"
0	200	Donald Trump will address the nation from New York City this evening as the president elect of the United States . 
0	200	 The Trump campaign has been holding its election night party all night at the New York Hilton Midtown , with the festivities beginning at 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time . 
0	200	 Trump 's supporters have become more and more energized as the hours have ticked on , and Trump will take the stage to address them soon . 
0	200	 The speech can be viewed live in the embedded YouTube player via Right Side Broadcasting . 
0	200	 It 's not currently known when Trump will take the stage , as we 're still awaiting for many more results to come in . 
0	200	 But at about 1:00 a.m. , Decision Desk HQ officially made their call that Donald Trump has been elected president , and it looks incredibly unlikely that the election will end any other way at this point . 
0	200	 It 's difficult to overstate how monumental of an event this is in the history of American politics . 
0	200	 Donald Trump went into this election night being seen as having no real shot at the White House , with many Democrats not even expecting the race to be remotely close . 
0	200	 Trump has pulled off what will likely go down as the most shocking political upset in history , and the election result proved nearly every single poll and electoral projection wrong . 
0	200	 In fact , it seemed for a while that even Donald Trump himself was n't sure that he was going to win the election . 
0	200	" After all , when he was asked during the presidential debate whether he would concede to Hillary Clinton if he loses , Trump refused to commit to doing so , saying , "" I 'll keep you in suspense "" seemingly because part of him doubted he could pull this thing off . "
0	200	 Obviously , conceding to Hillary Clinton is no longer an issue . 
0	200	 So what will Trump say in his speech tonight ?

1	201	During the campaign , Donald J. Trump made lots of promises -- he 'd be the greatest jobs president God ever created , he 'd cut taxes , he 'd balance the budget , he 'd give all Americans fantastic health care , he 'd renegotiate NAFTA , he 'd scotch the Iran deal and so on . 
1	201	 But there was one central promise without which he would n't have been elected : He said he 'd build a wall . 
1	201	 Either Trump understood the urgency of our border crisis , as his every campaign speech suggested , or it was just meaningless boilerplate to get himself elected . 
1	201	 If it was the latter , then our search continues for one politician who wo n't lie to us . 
1	201	 It was precisely the Nietzschean Eternal Recurrence of politicians promising to get tough on immigration , but never , ever doing it , that caused voters to cling to Trump like a life vest in a tidal wave . 
1	201	 If Trump actually believed what he claimed to believe , he would treat the building of a wall as a far more urgent priority than sending FEMA after a hurricane . 
1	201	 Taking nothing away from the fine people who lost their lives in the recent hurricanes , since the 2005 hurricane season , about 200 Americans have died in hurricanes , plus 82 in Hurricane Harvey and 50 in Hurricane Irma . 
1	201	 That 's 332 deaths from hurricanes in the past 12 years . 
1	201	 Even a federal government determined not to tell Americans how many illegal immigrants are committing crimes admits that -- at a minimum -- there are 350,000 illegal immigrants incarcerated in state prisons and jails , and 3,500 are in for murder . 
1	201	 Considering that the average time served for murder in America is six years , that means that , in the last 12 years , hurricanes have killed 332 Americans , and illegal immigrants have killed 7,000 Americans . 
1	201	 Throw in the more than 30,000 Americans who die every year from heroin and fentanyl brought in by Mexicans , and illegal immigration is a problem at least 100 times more urgent than Hurricanes Harvey , Irma and every other hurricane since 2005 , combined . 
1	201	 ( If we 're including U.S. territories and Hurricane Maria ends up killing another 100 people -- current estimates are zero dead -- illegal immigration is still 80 times worse than the last 12 years of deadly hurricanes . 
1	201	 Of course , if we 're including territories , then we also must note that illegal immigration is especially disastrous for Puerto Ricans living in the U.S. , in terms of crime and diminishing job prospects . ) 
1	201	 There is no question but that illegal immigration dwarfs any other issue , not only in dead Americans , but also in welfare expenditures , taxes , lost jobs , police and prison expenditures , declining neighborhoods , ruined schools , overwhelmed hospitals , facial reconstruction surgeries and rape counseling services , to name a few costs . 
1	201	 We thought Trump understood this . 
1	201	 We were counting on him to fight for us on the border -- not with rallies , not with hats , not with tweets , but by building a wall . 
1	201	 And yet , as of Wednesday this week , Trump will have been in office 243 days without having begun the wall . 
1	201	 Imagine if Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had hit 243 days ago and all we 'd gotten from the president were assurances that FEMA would be coming any day now -- just as soon as he got the go - ahead from Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan ! ( 
1	201	 Or worse , from Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer . ) 
1	201	 The more accurate analogy would be if Trump responded to the recent hurricanes not only by sending zero federal aid , but also by demanding that we dismantle FEMA and the National Hurricane Center . 
1	201	 That 's exactly what he 's doing by proposing we respond to the crisis of 40 million illegal aliens in our country with an amnesty that will lure another 40 million across the border . 
1	201	 We hoped we would n't have to spell it out . 
1	201	 We thought Trump understood that this was an emergency . 
1	201	 We believed he was capable of getting the job done . 
1	201	 If he did understand , then 243 days ago , he would have sent the Navy Seabees and Army Corps of Engineers to start building the wall . 
1	201	 For most of the nation 's history , the primary job of the military -- of which President Trump is the commander in chief -- was building walls and fortresses on our borders . 
1	201	 That 's why we have an Army Corps of Engineers . 
1	201	 It may not seem like it from recent history , but the job of our military is to protect America 's borders -- not Ukraine 's borders , not Jordan 's borders . 
1	201	 This is our one and only chance to get this done , and we 're losing the fight . 
1	201	 While Trump dallies , last week California became a sanctuary state . 
1	201	 Sixteen - year - old girls are taking lessons to learn to be safe drivers , but when they 're smashed into by drunk - driving illegal aliens , the state wo n't tell ICE , and taxpayers will spend $ 40 million to pay for their defense . 
1	201	 The wall has to get built , and nothing else matters . 
1	201	 Trump will not be able to tweet his way out of not building the wall . 
1	201	 He will not be able to change the subject by attacking the media or Crooked Hillary . 
1	201	 He will not be able to get away with blaming Republicans in Congress . 
1	201	 Obviously , it suits the rest of the traitorous GOP -- which ferociously opposed him -- to pretend that Trump 's election had nothing to do with immigration . 
1	201	 I do n't know about a lot of things . 
1	201	 I do n't know which part of their bodies women will let you grab if you 're a rich celebrity . 
1	201	 I do n't know how to play a wind instrument . 
1	201	 But when everyone else said Trump was a joke , I said , nope , he 's going to be our next president . 
1	201	" If anyone is telling Trump that a "" virtual wall , "" drones , a conga line or a "" Do n't Cross ! "" "
1	201	 sign are as good as a wall , he can get his stock tips from them , but not his political advice . 
1	201	 If Trump does n't get that wall built , and fast , his base will be done with him and feed him to Robert Mueller .

1	203	 As I predicted , the erasing of American history will not be limited to Confederate monuments . 
1	203	 Last week a member of the board of trustees of the Dallas , Texas , school district recommended changing the name of James Madison High School . 
1	203	" James Madison was the father of the US Constitution , considered by Identity Politics , the political ideology of the Democratic Party and the American liberal / progressive / left , to be a "" racist document . "" "
1	203	 From a British reader comes the news that the various segments of Western society divided into victim groups by Identity Politics have divided very finely and have turned on one another . 
1	203	 On September 13 , the Trans - Exclusionary Radical Feminists ( TERFs ) and their bitter enemies , Trans Activists , clashed in a fist fight in London 's Hyde Park . 
1	203	" 60-year - old Maria MacLachlan , who describes herself as a "" gender critical feminist , "" was knocked to the ground . "
1	203	 The presstitutes at the New York Times even use the crossword puzzle to spread their lies and disinformation . 
1	203	" This morning one of the clues was "" like the peninsula seized by Russia in 2014 . "" "
1	203	 The NYT is referring to Crimea , for 300 years a Russian province with a Russian population that voted by a 97 % majority to rejoin Russia when the US overthrew the Ukrainian government in a coup . 
1	203	" The NYT presstitutes treat this exercise in democracy as "" Russian aggression . "" "
1	203	" As the "" newspaper of record , "" clearly the record is falsified . "
1	203	 My northern acquaintances believe that the South , by definition , is racist even though the cities that were the heart of the Confederacy are ruled by black mayors . 
1	203	 The mayor of Richmond , Virginia , the capital of the Confederacy , Levar Stoney , is black . 
1	203	 The mayor of Atlanta , Kasim Reed , is black . 
1	203	 The Mayor of Columbia , South Carolina , Stephen Benjamin , is black . 
1	203	 Because of Identity Politics , these black mayors can not prevent southern history from being cast down the Memory Hole . 
1	203	" Any black mayor who stood up for historical truth would be branded an "" Uncle Tom . "" "
1	203	 There is no greater absurdity than moving history off its factual basis and substituting a fictional basis as dictated by Identity Politics . 
1	203	 In the United States -- indeed , in the entirely of the Western world -- history has become a construction that serves not the truth but special interests . 
1	203	 This is the reason that the Western World is doomed .

0	204	The FBI is advising people to hang up if they receive a call from a woman screaming for help . 
0	204	 A decades - old virtual kidnapping scam is placing more U.S. residents at risk of becoming potential victims , the FBI warned on its website . 
0	204	" The scheme takes many forms , but basically callers trick victims into paying ransoms to free family or friends who have been "" kidnapped . "" "
0	204	 The virtual abductors coerce victims to pay a ransom before victims can find out that no one has been kidnapped . 
0	204	 The FBI had been tracking virtual kidnapping calls primarily from prisons in Mexico between 2013 and 2015 . 
0	204	 The callers targeted individuals who spoke Spanish , the FBI said . 
0	204	 Most of the victims were from the Los Angeles and Houston areas . 
0	204	 The FBI issued the warning because kidnappers have widened their pool of potential victims by no longer targeting only specific individuals and Spanish speakers . 
0	204	 The callers also are cold - calling numbers in various cities . 
0	204	 In a recent investigation , the FBI found that more than 80 people have fallen victim to the new tactics in California , Minnesota , Idaho and Texas . 
0	204	 Those victims paid more than $ 87,000 in ransom . 
0	204	 An FBI spokeswoman for the Kansas City offices said she was not aware of any instances that have occurred in Kansas or Missouri where the FBI was involved . 
0	204	" The scam works this way : The potential victim answers a call and hears a woman screaming , "" Help me ! "" "
0	204	 The victim might blurt out a name , like Mary , asking her if she 's OK . 
0	204	 At that point , the caller will tell the victim that Mary has been kidnapped and she will be harmed if ransom is n't paid quickly . 
0	204	 The scam is successful when victims do n't know the whereabouts of their loved ones . 
0	204	 The scammers typically demand that the ransoms are wired to Mexico . 
0	204	 The amount is typically less than $ 2,000 because of legal restrictions for wiring larger amounts across the border , the FBI said . 
0	204	 However , two victims in Houston were coerced to pay larger ransoms by making money drops . 
0	204	 A federal grand jury charged a 34-year - old Houston woman in July with 10 counts , including wire fraud and money laundering , for her involvement in the scam . 
0	204	 The charges are the first federal indictment in a virtual kidnapping case , the FBI said . 
0	204	 Robert A. Cronkleton : 816 - 234 - 4261 , @cronkb 
0	204	 How to avoid falling victim 
0	204	 If you receive a call from someone demanding ransom for an alleged kidnap victim , the FBI suggests : 
0	204	 Hang up the phone . 
0	204	 Do n't call out your loved one 's name if you do respond to call . 
0	204	 Request to speak with the alleged victim . 
0	204	 Ask questions only the alleged victim would know . 
0	204	 Listen to the voice of the alleged victim if they do speak . 
0	204	 Try to contact the alleged victim on the phone , text or social media . 
0	204	 Do n't agree to pay a ransom . 
0	204	 If you believe a real kidnapping has taken place , call 911 .

0	206	Postpartum depression has become more visible as celebrity moms including Brooke Shields , Drew Barrymore and Chrissy Teigen have publicly shared their struggles with feeling sad and hopeless after birth . 
0	206	" But when a father - Adam Busby , from reality TV show "" OutDaughtered "" - recently opened up about his own postpartum depression , he received instant backlash , including comments telling him to "" man up . "" "
0	206	 Despite the skepticism , postpartum depression in fathers is very real , with estimates that around 10 percent of men report symptoms of depression following the birth of a child , about double the typical rate of depression in males . 
0	206	 Postpartum depression in women has been linked with hormonal shifts , but the role of hormones in men 's postpartum depression has been unknown . 
0	206	 In an attempt to solve this mystery , my colleagues and I recently tested whether men 's levels of the hormone testosterone are related to their postpartum depression risk during early parenthood . 
0	206	 We found that men 's testosterone levels might predict not only their own postpartum depression risk , but their partner 's depression risk as well . 
0	206	 Testosterone levels in flux through life changes 
0	206	 Testosterone is an androgen hormone , responsible for the development and maintenance of male secondary sex characteristics . 
0	206	 It promotes muscle mass and body hair growth , and motivates sexual arousal and competitive behavior . 
0	206	 Many studies have found that testosterone dips in new fathers across the animal kingdom . 
0	206	 Among animals that engage in the biparental care of offspring - Mongolian gerbils , Djungarian hamsters , California mice and cotton - top tamarins - males show lower testosterone levels following the birth of pups . 
0	206	 Human males also often show declines in testosterone around the birth of their infants . 
0	206	 In one of the largest studies of testosterone and fatherhood , anthropologist Lee Gettler and his colleagues followed over 600 single men in the Philippines for about five years . 
0	206	 If men became partnered fathers during that time , their testosterone levels decreased more than the men who stayed single . 
0	206	 Gettler also found that fathers who spent more time with their children showed lower testosterone , suggesting that testosterone may be suppressed by paternal caregiving . 
0	206	 Along similar lines , psychologist Robin Edelstein and I found that men assessed repeatedly over their partner 's pregnancy showed declining testosterone levels from early to late pregnancy . 
0	206	 Men whose testosterone dropped more dramatically were more likely to report postpartum commitment and investment in their romantic relationships with their partners . 
0	206	 Researchers still have n't identified exactly what causes men 's testosterone to change over the transition to parenthood . 
0	206	 Possible suspects include proximity to the partner or infant , increased stress or disrupted sleep and exercise routines . 
0	206	 Lower testosterone , higher depression 
0	206	 Previous research has linked testosterone with men 's depression levels in general . 
0	206	 Low testosterone may contribute to the feelings of lethargy and disinterest in normally pleasurable activities that characterize depression . 
0	206	 In fact , some psychiatrists have even suggested prescribing testosterone supplements to treat depression in men . 
0	206	 However , no studies had specifically looked at the potential role of testosterone in fathers ' postpartum depression . 
0	206	 My colleagues and I analyzed data from the Community Child Health Research Network , a National Institutes of Health - funded study of new parents ' health and well - being . 
0	206	 The study recruited moms after the birth of an infant and followed them for several years , along with their partners . 
0	206	 At one of the study sites , in Lake County , Illinois , men also provided saliva samples for testosterone analysis when their infants were around nine months old . 
0	206	 Both moms and dads reported on their symptoms of depression several times across the first few years of parenthood . 
0	206	 We found that dads with lower testosterone reported feeling more depressed . 
0	206	 This fits with other research into how testosterone and depression work together . 
0	206	 But ours is the first study to observe this relationship specifically in fathers of infants . 
0	206	 Given that many men show drops in testosterone over the transition to parenthood , this finding may help explain why the postpartum period is such a high - risk time for depression in men . 
0	206	 An unexpected side effect - for the moms 
0	206	 We were surprised when we examined links between men 's testosterone and their partners ' depression . 
0	206	 Yes , low testosterone seemed to put men at higher risk for depressive symptoms . 
0	206	 But men 's levels had the opposite effect for their partners : Women with lower - testosterone partners actually reported fewer symptoms of depression . 
0	206	 Why would that be ? 
0	206	 We tested one possible explanation by looking at how women rated their relationships . 
0	206	 It turned out that moms paired with low - testosterone men reported higher relationship satisfaction , and their higher relationship satisfaction predicted lower rates of depressive symptoms . 
0	206	 In other words , having a low - testosterone mate might make for a better - quality relationship , in turn reducing the likelihood that women will become depressed . 
0	206	 We know social support from a partner can protect women against developing postpartum depression , so our finding fits with that research . 
0	206	 Lower - testosterone men may be more dedicated to their relationships or spend more time with children , helping to relieve some of the pressure on moms . 
0	206	 At around 15 months postpartum , we also checked moms ' ratings of whether their partners hurt , threatened , yelled at or insulted them . 
0	206	 If men had higher testosterone , moms reported higher levels of intimate partner aggression about six months later . 
0	206	 Testosterone is associated with more aggressive and competitive behavior . 
0	206	 Our finding shows a potential dark side to high testosterone in the postpartum period . 
0	206	 Dads also told us about their parenting stress at 15 months postpartum , reporting on emotions such as feeling trapped by parenting responsibilities , believing their children made too many demands on them and lacking warm feelings toward their children . 
0	206	 At first , we did n't find a link between men 's testosterone levels and their parenting stress . 
0	206	 But after we statistically controlled for the relationship between low testosterone and depression , we saw that higher testosterone put men at greater risk of experiencing problems in the parenting relationship . 
0	206	 This result suggests that , once you adjust for their potentially lower risk of depression , high - testosterone men may find parenting to be more stressful . 
0	206	 A happy medium for testosterone ? 
0	206	 Our results suggest that fathers of infants might be at risk at both sides of the postpartum testosterone spectrum . 
0	206	 At low levels , they might be more vulnerable to depression . 
0	206	 But at high levels , they might have less satisfying and more aggressive relationships , less happy partners and more parenting stress . 
0	206	 In terms of resilience to depression and stress , men with average levels of postpartum testosterone seemed to fare best . 
0	206	 Our findings reveal that men 's postpartum testosterone has a complex relationship with family health . 
0	206	 From an evolutionary perspective , lower testosterone during the transition to parenthood may help motivate men to invest in their family . 
0	206	 In the animal kingdom , lower - testosterone males spend more time with infant pups and show less aggression toward them . 
0	206	 So it makes sense that human males would show shifts in testosterone as they adapt to parenthood . 
0	206	 But these shifts may make men more vulnerable to mood disorder symptoms . 
0	206	 Perhaps this is because lower - testosterone men are taking a more hands - on role in the family and helping more with infant care . 
0	206	 Their contributions are great news from the family 's perspective , but may put men at heightened risk of some of the same depressive symptoms that many new mothers face . 
0	206	 After all , caring for infants is hard , draining work . 
0	206	 In modern industrialized societies like the United States , many new parents lack the extended family support networks that can help lighten the burden of childcare . 
0	206	 And in the U.S. , paternity leave is a rarity , and many dads struggle with family - unfriendly work arrangements that drain time and energy . 
0	206	 Just as new moms can feel overwhelmed and isolated after spending long hours tending to their babies , so too can dads . 
0	206	 If new dads ( or moms ) are experiencing depressed moods after the birth of their infants , they can take some comfort in the fact that these feelings are normal - and may even be rooted in our evolutionary biology . 
0	206	 There 's no shame in seeking help , whether it 's talking to a friend , prioritizing sleep and exercise , or visiting a therapist . 
0	206	 Postpartum depression affects the whole family and should be taken seriously .

0	210	Rolling Stone contributing editor Sabrina Rubin Erdely , front , and Rolling Stone magazine Deputy Managing Editor Sean Woods , right , walk with their legal team to federal court in Charlottesville , Va. , Tuesday , Nov. 1 , 2016 . 
0	210	 University of Virginia administrator Nicole Eramo is seeking $ 7.5 million from the magazine over its portrayal of her in a 2014 story written by Rubin Erdely . 
0	210	 Closing arguments in the case are continuing . 
0	210	 CHARLOTTESVILLE , Va. - The reporter of a botched Rolling Stone article about a brutal gang rape at the University of Virginia willfully ignored facts and statements that disproved her preconceived storyline about the school 's callousness toward sexual - assault victims , an attorney for the former associate dean of students said in his closing arguments Tuesday . 
0	210	" University administrator Nicole Eramo is seeking $ 7.5 million from the magazine over its portrayal of her in the 2014 story by Sabrina Rubin Erdely about the alleged sexual assault of a woman identified only as "" Jackie . "" "
0	210	 Eramo claims she was unfairly portrayed in the article as trying to sweep Jackie 's sexual assault under the rug in order to protect the university . 
0	210	" Attorney Tom Clare argued Tuesday that Erdely set out from the beginning to tell a story of "" institutional indifference , "" brushed off statements from her sources that did n't fit that narrative and pushed her own views about the administration onto the vulnerable women she was interviewing . "
0	210	" "" Once they decided what the article was going to be about , it did n't matter what the facts were , "" Clare said . "
0	210	 The story about Jackie 's rape set off a firestorm at the University of Virginia and in schools nationwide and prompted police to launch an investigation into the alleged assault . 
0	210	 Eramo received hundreds of angry letters and emails and faced protesters outside her office . 
0	210	 The story crumbled after other news outlets began asking questions and police found no evidence to back up Jackie 's claims . 
0	210	 The article was officially retracted in April 2015 . 
0	210	" Eramo must prove that Rolling Stone statements about her made her appear "" odious , infamous or ridiculous "" and that the magazine acted with "" actual malice , "" meaning it knew that what it was writing about her was false or should have known it was false . "
0	210	 A lawyer for Rolling Stone , Scott Sexton , said in closing statements there is no evidence the magazine knew a botched story about a gang rape at the University of Virginia was false before publishing it . 
0	210	" While the women Erdely interviewed - including Jackie - told her that Eramo was their fiercest advocate , Clare argued that Erdely was so invested in her preconceived storyline that she was "" blind to the facts . "" "
0	210	" He argued that Erdely purposely set out to make Eramo the "" villain "" because she knew she was an "" easy target "" and could n't speak publicly about Jackie 's case due to federal privacy laws . "
0	210	" "" It 's reckless , it 's cavalier and it 's intentional , "" Clare said . "

1	212	 It was a shocking and cravenly irresponsible thing to say , the sort of thing that threatens to rend our national fabric , and for that alone , Trump has earned his place in the history of American ignominy . 
1	212	 But who needs to wait ? 
1	212	 Consciously or not , the guy ceded the race . 
1	212	 Live . 
1	212	 On television . 
1	212	 On Oct. 19 . 
1	212	 Lotsa luck indeed . 
1	212	 Hillary sure did luck out having him as her rival . 
1	212	 She can basically take the next three weeks off . 
1	212	 But why would she ? 
1	212	 She can just spend the time taking the most luxurious pre - victory lap in American history . 
1	212	" Trump will make that phone call on Nov. 8 or he wo n't , and he will or wo n't make that speech in which he tells his supporters , "" I just congratulated Hillary on becoming the next president and we must all come together . "" "
1	212	 There 's no telling . 
1	212	 This is a test of character , but Trump has a different understanding of such tests of character — and he might believe he will only pass such a test by doing what he can to continue to be the expression of the American i d 's rage and disappointment . 
1	212	 His refusal to do so would be the mark of a tragic decline in our polity , as would the refusal of some significant numbers of his supporters to accept the results as well . 
1	212	 But this is the story of 2016 . 
1	212	 He refused to do other things as well — like concede the fact that the Russian government is attempting to interfere with the election . 
1	212	 Hillary Clinton said three times that 17 different US military and intelligence agencies have determined that this is so . 
1	212	" Due to his truly bizarre unwillingness to say anything really negative about Russia 's dictator , Trump just said no to that — and handed Hillary her sound bite of the night : "" He 'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and intelligence people who are sworn to protect us . "" "
1	212	 How was the debate ? 
1	212	 Well , it was reasonably substantive , largely due to Chris Wallace 's absolutely perfect work as the moderator . 
1	212	 And if you went moment by moment and point by point , you would probably score it reasonably closely . 
1	212	 Trump zinged her on several patent dishonesties , and as usual , she handled the zinging badly . 
1	212	 On the other hand , every time she needed a way out of a corner , she baited him with something — women he 'd said bad things about , or the money he 'd borrowed from his father — and he 'd fall for it every time . 
1	212	 But let 's face it : Do you really want me to tell you who I think won the exchange on entitlements ? 
1	212	 I mean , who cares ? 
1	212	 Does it bother me that Hillary Clinton said she was going to apply a strict left - liberal litmus test to her Supreme Court appointments ? 
1	212	 Yes , it does , but I knew that already , and if you follow the issue , so did you . 
1	212	 Very few people are voting in this election on matters of conventional governmental policy . 
1	212	 A great many will vote for the team they 've long been signed up with , while everybody else will be voting against one of these two extremely unattractive and unpopular candidates . 
1	212	 Trump just told us he knows she has more people voting in her favor and he has more people voting against him . 
1	212	 He just told Hillary to measure the drapes . 
1	212	 He can spend the rest of his life never conceding , and she 's still going to be the 45th president of the United States .Donald Trump just ceded the presidency to Hillary Clinton

0	214	A Grain of Saul is a weekly column that digs into some of the biggest issues we face as a nation and as an international community in search of reliable data , realistic solutions , and — most importantly — hope . 
0	214	 More and more women are reporting that Harvey Weinstein harassed or sexually assaulted them . 
0	214	" After an explosive piece in The New York Times , which cited several women 's firsthand accounts of Weinstein 's alleged "" sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact , "" it appears the dam has broken . "
0	214	 Yesterday , a piece in The New Yorker quoted nearly a dozen on the record firsthand accounts of Weinstein 's harassment and sexual assault and included never - before - heard audio recordings from a New York Police Department sting operation in which Weinstein appears to admit to groping model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez . 
0	214	 Although Weinstein apologized in a statement for at least some of the behavior referenced in the New York Times article , he denied the sexual assault allegations following the New Yorker piece 's release . 
0	214	 That piece , a gut - punch for anyone holding out hope the worst was n't true , was notably written by journalist Ronan Farrow . 
0	214	 Farrow is the estranged son of Woody Allen , another Hollywood magnate accused of sexual assault . 
0	214	 Those allegations ( which Allen denies ) were made by his own daughter , Ronan 's sister Dylan . 
0	214	 With so many accusers against Weinstein now on the record , including household names like Gwyneth Paltrow , Cara Delevingne and Angelina Jolie , all corners of the country are offering their hot takes in the discussion . 
0	214	" Perhaps one of the most unfortunate reactions has been to politicize the story , as some conservative pundits have grasped onto Weinstein — a major Democratic donor Michelle Obama once publicly praised as a "" wonderful human being "" — as illustrative of rotten liberal America . "
0	214	 But this is n't a uniquely Democratic problem . 
0	214	 Fox News , a notoriously right - wing news outlet , has had to dismiss a slew of on - air talent because of sexual assault allegations . 
0	214	 Our Republican president appeared to admit on tape to sexually assaulting women ( and has also been photographed chumming it up with Weinstein ) . 
0	214	 The point being : this is n't a partisan or even a political issue . 
0	214	 This is — largely — an issue with men , specifically men who yield any kind of power . 
0	214	 The allegations leveled against Weinstein , Allen , Bill Cosby , Bill O'Reilly , Roger Ailes , Anthony Weiner and President Trump are not unique to Hollywood or a certain political party . 
0	214	 It 's not always famous and powerful men , either : it 's the Catholic Church , Penn State football , orthodox Jews , professional athletes , universities , and your local retail store . 
0	214	 The list goes on . 
0	214	 In many of the cases that have made national headlines , though , wealthy men in positions of significant power have leveraged their status to pressure or force women into sexual encounters . 
0	214	 Those women are then shamed , threatened with lawsuits and silenced if they speak out . 
0	214	 Perhaps most unsettling about these stories is that there is almost always someone who could have stepped up and stopped the harassment or assault . 
0	214	 In Farrow 's story , he wrote that 16 former and current employees of Weinstein 's companies had witnessed or had knowledge of unwanted sexual advances Weinstein made in work - related settings . 
0	214	 Sixteen ! 
0	214	 And that 's just the number of current or former employees who happened to speak to Farrow . 
0	214	 What about all the ones who did n't ? 
0	214	 What about the ones who were too scared to speak to a reporter ? 
0	214	 Weinstein 's case , again , is n't unique . 
0	214	" In President Trump 's infamous Hollywood Access tape , television host Billy Bush laughs offthe notion that Trump could simply "" grab women by the pussy "" because he was a star . "
0	214	" His supporters and advisers dismissed it as "" locker room talk . "" "
0	214	 Former Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly and former CEO Roger Ailes were repeatedly reported to human resources at Fox Newsand , reportedly , no action was taken . 
0	214	 Football coach Joe Paterno was let go from Penn State because of what he may or may not have known about convicted rapist Jerry Sandusky . 
0	214	 An entire film was made about the Catholic Church spending years trying to fend off reporters who wanted to get the truth out about rampant sexual abuse by priests . 
0	214	 In many cases , campus rape stories include bystanders who do n't intervene when a clearly intoxicated woman is taken home by a less intoxicated man . 
0	214	 People — especially men who are in positions of power — have the ability to step in and stop these stories from happening . 
0	214	 And we can not forget that there are male survivors of sexual assault , and they are every bit as worth protecting . 
0	214	 Terry Crews came out on Twitter to share a story about being assaulted by another man who allegedly grabbed his penis while Crews was standing next to his wife at a Hollywood function . 
0	214	" Crews said he decided not to retaliate with allegations against the man because he did n't want to be ostracized , noting that "" the predator has power and influence . "" "
0	214	 Instead , he let it go , like many women do , because he could n't stop asking himself if anyone believe him and if the repercussions for speaking out would be life - changing . 
0	214	 If Terry Crews , a wealthy , well - known man is wary of reporting his assault , imagine the obstacles that face many other sexual assault survivors . 
0	214	 It 's time for men to police our own communities , our own friends and our own family members . 
0	214	 It 's time for men to stop being passive observers of the kinds of harassment and overt sexism that are all too common in the spaces we dominate . 
0	214	 It 's time for men to stand up for the victims we see in our day - to - day lives , and to create spaces , environments , communities , teams , companies and homes where everyone feels safe and supported enough to speak truth to power . 
0	214	" The issue of sexual assault can not simply be a "" women 's issue . "" "
0	214	 It can not be a political talking point . 
0	214	 It can not be a Democrat or Republican or religious or campus issue . 
0	214	 Sexual assault is a men 's issue . 
0	214	 It is my issue . 
0	214	 It is your issue . 
0	214	 And it 's about time we did something about it .A Grain Of Saul : Stopping Sexual Assault Is Not A Partisan Issue Or A Women 's Issue . It 's Up To All Of Us .
0	215	Sabrina Rubin Erdely 
0	215	" An attorney for the former University of Virginia dean suing Rolling Stone for defamation alleged during closing arguments that the magazine 's campus rape story was reported with a "" reckless disregard for the truth . "" "
0	215	" Attorney Tom Clare charged that Rolling Stone "" needed a villain "" for the Nov. 2014 feature piece — and the story 's author , Sabrina Erdely , decided former associate dean of students Nicole Eramo fit the bill . "
0	215	" "" Every one of her stories has a victim , a villain and a vindicator … Ms. Erdely and Rolling Stone were intent on imposing that on this story , "" Clare said . "
0	215	" "" It had all of the elements of a perfect story , but when something sounds too perfect to be true , it probably is . "" "
0	215	" Eramo , who is seeking $ 7.5 million , claims the since - discredited story portrayed her as turning a blind eye to gang rape claims made by a former student identified as "" Jackie . "" "
0	215	 Clare argued that the defamation case is not about rape , but about journalistic failure . 
0	215	 The lawyer said Erdely left out important details in her piece on purpose , like the fact that Eramo took Jackie to the police on two separate occasions . 
0	215	 ‘ Every one of her stories has a victim , a villain and a vindicator … ' 
0	215	" "" They made a decision to remove [ from the article ] every reference to the police and that 's actual malice , "" he said . "
0	215	 Clare also blasted Erdely for ignoring red flags , such as Jackie 's refusal to put her in touch with sources who could corroborate her alleged gang rape account . 
0	215	" "" Jackie 's refusal to put Ms. Erdely in touch with people who could confirm or deny her story was a giant , waving red flag , "" he insisted . "
0	215	" "" Once they decided what the article was going to be , it did n't matter what the facts were , "" Clare added . "
0	215	" Rolling Stone 's attorney Scott Sexton countered that Erdely put a "" tremendous amount of work "" into the article , but was ultimately fooled by Jackie . "
0	215	" "" Sabrina was acting in good faith when she wrote the article with the information she had , "" he insisted . "" "
0	215	" Our world would shut down if we walked out that court room door and expected everyone to lie to us . "" "
0	215	 Sexton also said that because Eramo is a public figure , Erdely had every right to criticize her . 
0	215	" "" She is a highly compensated public servant … we are entitled as citizens to criticize a public figure , "" he explained . "
0	215	" Sexton argued that Eramo 's attorneys are intent on proving that the story was republished in Dec. 2014 — when the magazine added an editor 's note to the piece after Jackie 's rape account had been called into question — because they , "" have no case for actual malice "" before then . "
0	215	" One of the questions jurors will be asked is whether they believe that Rolling Stone "" affirmatively reiterated the content of any false and defamatory statements . ""Ex - UVA dean 's lawyer blasts Rolling Stone editor 's ‘ reckless ' rape story"

1	216	 DON LEMON , CNN : Well , what do you say to that ? 
1	216	 I 'm just going to speak from the heart here . 
1	216	 What we have witnessed is a total eclipse of the facts . 
1	216	 Someone who came out on stage and lied directly the American people and left things out that he said in an attempt to rewrite history , especially when it comes to Charlottesville . 
1	216	 He 's unhinged , it 's embarrassing and I do n't mean for us , the media because he went after us , but for the country . 
1	216	 This is who we elected president of the United States . 
1	216	 A man who is so petty that he has to go after people who he deems to be his enemy , like an imaginary friend of a 6-year - old . 
1	216	 His speech was without thought , it was without reason , it was devoid of facts , it was devoid of wisdom . 
1	216	 There was no gravitas . 
1	216	 There was no sanity there . 
1	216	 He was like a child blaming a sibling on something else . 
1	216	 He did it , I did n't do it . 
1	216	 He certainly opened up the race wound from Charlottesville . 
1	216	 A man clearly wounded by the rational people who are abandoning him in droves , meaning those business people and the people in Washington now who are questioning his fitness for office and whether he is stable . 
1	216	 A man backed into a corner it seems by circumstances beyond his control and beyond his understanding . 
1	216	 That 's the truth . 
1	216	 If you watch that speech as an American , you had to be thinking what in the world is going on ? 
1	216	 This is the person we elected as president of the United States ?

1	220	Jul 1 , 2017 at 3:15 PM 
1	220	 The progressive strategy of investigating President Donald Trump nonstop for Russian collusion or obstruction of justice or witness tampering so far has produced no substantial evidence of wrongdoing . 
1	220	 The alternate strategy of derailing the new administration before it really gets started has n't succeeded either , despite serial efforts to sue over election results , alter the Electoral College vote , boycott the inauguration , delay the confirmation of appointments , demand recusals , promise Trump 's impeachment or removal through the 25th Amendment , and file suit under the Emoluments Clause . 
1	220	 A third strategy of portraying Trump as a veritable monster likewise so far has failed in four special elections for House seats . 
1	220	 Apparently progressives have accepted the idea that Barack Obama 's formula of twice winning the Electoral College is not yet transferable to other progressive candidates such as Hillary Clinton . 
1	220	 And they probably have concluded that Obama 's progressive political agenda proved unpopular with voters by 2010 and had to be implemented by ad hoc executive orders — presidential prerogatives now utilized by Donald Trump to overturn the ones Obama issued . 
1	220	 A fourth potential pathway to power would be a return to Bill Clinton 's pragmatic agendas of the 1990s . 
1	220	 But apparently progressives find that centrist remedy worse than the malady of losing elections — given that during the Obama tenure , more than 1,000 state and local offices were lost to Republicans , in addition to majorities in the House and Senate , and a majority of governorships and legislatures . 
1	220	 What next ? 
1	220	 Trump acts as if he is a Nietzschean figure , assuming that anything that does not destroy him only makes him stronger . 
1	220	 And now , slowly , his accusers are becoming the accused . 
1	220	 One nagging problem with the progressive case against Trump for purported Russian collusion and obstruction of justice was that members of the Obama administration had more exposure to those allegations than did the political newcomer Trump . 
1	220	 Last year , then - FBI Director James Comey testified that not only did former Attorney General Loretta Lynch improperly meet in secret with Bill Clinton during an investigation of Hillary Clinton , but that Lynch had asked Comey to downplay the investigation into Hillary 's use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state . 
1	220	 Comey confessed that he had reluctantly agreed to Lynch 's request . 
1	220	 Last month , in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee , Comey admitted that he asked a friend to leak notes about Comey 's earlier conversation with Trump in hopes of forcing the nomination of a special investigator to lead the Russia investigation — perhaps a successful gambit , given that Comey 's friend , former FBI Director Robert Mueller , was soon appointed to that role . 
1	220	 Comey also wrongly dismissed Hillary Clinton 's email problems because of a perceived lack of criminal intent — a supposedly mitigating circumstance that legally should have had no bearing on things . 
1	220	 As far as alleged Russian collusion , there had long been conservative accusations that Bill and Hillary Clinton used Hillary 's status as secretary of state to leverage honoraria for Bill and donations to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for concessions to Russian interests . 
1	220	 Moreover , Russian tampering efforts had been going on for months before the 2016 election , but without any retaliatory measures from the Obama administration , which knew about Russia 's meddling . 
1	220	" In an inadvertent hot - mic request in 2012 , Obama asked outgoing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to urge Russian President Vladimir Putin "" to give me space "" during Obama 's re - election campaign , so that after his assumed success , Obama could reciprocate with "" more flexibility "" on Russian issues . "
1	220	 In the present highly charged climate , would that be seen as a form of Russian collusion ? 
1	220	 Meanwhile , the House Intelligence Committee is still investigating whether top Obama administration officials wrongfully used the power of foreign - intelligence collection to conduct surveillance of Americans — particularly members of the Trump campaign . 
1	220	 The point is not whether the Clintons , James Comey , Barack Obama or members of the Obama administration can be proven to have engaged in illegal or unscrupulous behavior . 
1	220	 Rather , the lesson is that progressives should have offered alternative political visions that might have won back the American people rather than attempting to terminate the Trump presidency on charges to which the progressive side was far more vulnerable . 
1	220	 Now that Trump is emerging from successful House special elections and has fended off six months of media attacks , celebrity invective and progressive efforts to abort his tenure , he seems to be going back on the offensive . 
1	220	 Currently , House and Senate investigations are doing to Democrats what has been done Trump . 
1	220	 So far these probes seem to have better chances to prove alleged wrongdoing . 
1	220	 What does all this political back - and - forth mean ? 
1	220	 Democrats struck preemptively to take out Trump before he unwound the Obama legacy . 
1	220	 That effort has probably been stalled . 
1	220	 The return volley is being launched at a time when an energized Trump is gaining momentum on health care and tax reform , and an improving economy . 
1	220	 In sum , to thwart a new president 's policies , it is probably wiser to offer alternative agendas instead of trying to destroy him before he has even entered office . 
1	220	 Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University .Hanson : Progressive attacks on Trump are backfiring
1	221	"Fulfilling his role as the titular head of "" The Resistance , "" Barack Obama took to Facebook Tuesday to snipe at the Trump administration 's announcement that it was rescinding the 44th president 's 2012 executive action called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals . "
1	221	" "" We should n't threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own , "" Obama said . "
1	221	 His post was florid and self - serving . 
1	221	" But five words in his lengthy screed —""through no fault of their own "" -- are undeniably true . "
1	221	" It 's not the fault of the "" dreamers "" that their parents brought them here , without papers , as minors . "
1	221	 On that we can agree . 
1	221	 But whose fault is it that they are still in limbo ? 
1	221	 For that answer , Obama need n't take to social media . 
1	221	 He can simply look in the mirror . 
1	221	 Ten years ago , a narrow consensus was forged in Washington , if only briefly . 
1	221	 Its architects were Edward Kennedy and John McCain . 
1	221	 Their carefully crafted legislation created a new temporary work visa , established an electronic data base for employers to check employees ' work status , and earmarked money for border enforcement . 
1	221	 It also provided a path to citizenship for an estimated 11.6 million illegal immigrants , provided they paid a fine and back taxes , met English and civics requirements , and stayed on the right side of the law . 
1	221	 President George W. Bush signaled his support . 
1	221	 But the vote was going to be close , which Kennedy and McCain knew . 
1	221	 Conservatives dismissed the path - to - citizenship as a fig leaf for amnesty . 
1	221	 Organized labor hated the guest - worker program , known as Y-1 . 
1	221	 McCain and Kennedy could have overcome that opposition , albeit narrowly , except for one last little group of senators . 
1	221	 Call it the Senate Presidential Wannabe Caucus . 
1	221	 Its membership included Illinois freshman Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York . 
1	221	 That 's only two votes , but it was enough . 
1	221	 On June 6 , 2007 , Sen. Byron Dorgan , a North Dakota Democrat , introduced an innocuous - sounding rider to the McCain - Kennedy bill . 
1	221	" Its official description was "" an amendment to sunset the Y-1 non - immigrant visa program after a 5-year period . "" "
1	221	" As everyone in the Senate understood , this was a "" poison pill "" designed not to shore up the bill , but sink it . "
1	221	 Dorgan got his way , too . 
1	221	 The amendment passed 49 - 48 , essentially killing comprehensive immigration reform . 
1	221	 Kennedy was incensed . 
1	221	 He 'd implored Dorgan and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid not to do it . 
1	221	 McCain felt particularly sandbagged by Obama , who 'd inserted himself into the legislative negotiations uninvited , wrangled a concession he wanted , then voted with Dorgan . 
1	221	 McCain assumed Obama did n't want George W. Bush or himself -- the man Obama expected to face in 2008 -- to get credit for immigration reform . 
1	221	 Ted Kennedy , who ended up endorsing Obama over Clinton anyway , believed this , too . 
1	221	 Kennedy died in 2009 before he could convince Obama to revisit this issue . 
1	221	 It would n't have mattered . 
1	221	 The GOP was becoming more nativist , the Democrats more cynical . 
1	221	 The chance for a legislative solution had come and gone . 
1	221	 But what about a non - legislative solution ? 
1	221	 This turned out to be President Obama 's specialty , the niceties of constitutional democracy be damned . 
1	221	" In June 2012 , with shifting public opinion polls now in his favor , Obama issued DACA , which he called "" a temporary , stopgap measure "" to curb the practice of deporting undocumented Americans brought to this country before their 16th birthday . "
1	221	 Was this constitutional ? 
1	221	" It might have been , had the president announced that because his Justice Department lacked the personnel to adequately adjudicate 11 million cases , it was necessary to prioritize law enforcement 's areas of emphasis and that , henceforth , no federal government resources would be spent on deporting the "" Dreamers . "" "
1	221	 Wink . 
1	221	 Wink . 
1	221	 But that 's not what Obama did . 
1	221	 He announced a formal new government program granting work permits to those without papers . 
1	221	" This "" temporary , stopgap "" measure superseded existing federal immigration law and , two years later , Obama sought to expand DACA , prompting a legal challenge from several states . "
1	221	 Was the president on shaky constitutional ground ? 
1	221	 One assumes so , if for no other reason than Obama repeatedly said so himself - and he did it in precise and colorful language . 
1	221	" On Cinco de Mayo in 2010 , he said , "" Anybody who tells you … that I can wave a magic wand and make it happen has n't been paying attention to how this town works . "" "
1	221	" "" I am president , I am not king , "" he said that October . "" "
1	221	" I ca n't do these things just by myself . "" "
1	221	" "" I know some here wish that I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself . "
1	221	" But that 's not how democracy works , "" he said in April 2011 . "
1	221	" "" I swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books , "" he added in July 2011 . "" … "
1	221	 Now , I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own . 
1	221	 Believe me , the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting … but that 's not how our system works . 
1	221	" That 's not how our Constitution is written . "" "
1	221	 Later , he had the temerity to claim he had n't changed his stance , a howler that blew the minds of media fact - checkers . 
1	221	 So that 's the backstory to Attorney General Jeff Sessions ' Tuesday announcement that the administration will rescind DACA because it 's unconstitutional . 
1	221	" Trump has not spoken against DACA itself ; moreover , he sent out a tweet reassuring "" Dreamers "" that they have nothing to worry about for six months . "
1	221	 This gambit suggests that Trump wants DACA codified into law , apparently as part of a comprehensive package . 
1	221	 Instead of responding to this overture in a spirit of compromise , Democrats chose vitriol and name - calling , their default position in the Trump era . 
1	221	" Luis Gutiérrez , an Illinois congressman , called White House Chief of Staff John Kelly a "" disgrace to the uniform he used to wear "" over DACA . "
1	221	 Remember last summer when every Democrat and most of the media went medieval on Trump for picking a fight with a Gold Star family ? 
1	221	 Well , John Kelly is a Gold Star dad , too . 
1	221	 Luis Gutiérrez never wore the uniform . 
1	221	 For sheer demagoguery , it was hard to top Bernie Sanders . 
1	221	" Hillary Clinton 's erstwhile rival had this to say : "" Trump 's decision on DACA is the ugliest and most cruel decision ever made by a president of the U.S. in the modern history of this country . "" "
1	221	 When one considers Woodrow Wilson re - segregating the federal workforce or FDR interning 110,000 Japanese - Americans who committed no crime , the thought occurs that this is possibly the most ignorant utterance by a U.S. senator in the modern history of this country . 
1	221	" But historic amnesia was the Democrats ' de facto strategy and , in the interest of efficiency , they used the same talking points . "" "
1	221	" Trump is clueless & cruel , "" tweeted former California Sen. Barbara Boxer . "" "
1	221	" Above all he is a coward . "" "
1	221	" Nancy Pelosi described it as "" cowardice "" and "" cruelty . "" "
1	221	" Chuck Schumer called it "" heartless . "" "
1	221	 And so it went . 
1	221	 One wonders if this was DNC - circulated messaging , drawn up by some 24-year - old staffer . 
1	221	 Someone apparently too callow to know that today 's Democrats are a historic anomaly . 
1	221	 Normally Congress likes it when a president respects their prerogative to make law . 
1	221	 Or perhaps these talking points were n't written by a millennial . 
1	221	 Perhaps they were written by a certain ex - president trying to help us forget that when he and Hillary Clinton -- along with Barbara Boxer , Harry Reid , Chuck Schumer , and Bernie Sanders -- had the chance to grant 11 million immigrants access to the American Dream , they instead chose , for partisan purposes , to keep them in the shadows .

1	222	Hillary Clinton 
1	222	 Before Democrats burn James Comey in effigy , they should think about how the FBI director came to have an outsized influence in the election in the first place . 
1	222	 It 's not something Comey sought or welcomed . 
1	222	 A law enforcement official who prizes his reputation , he did n't relish becoming a hate figure for half the country or more . 
1	222	 No , the only reason that Comey figures in the election at all is that Democrats knowingly nominated someone under FBI investigation . 
1	222	 Once upon a time — namely any presidential election prior to this one — this enormous political and legal vulnerability would have disqualified a candidate . 
1	222	 Not this year , and not in the case of Hillary Clinton . 
1	222	 The country has clearly lowered its standards in this election , and Donald Trump 's madcap candidacy provides evidence of that almost every day . 
1	222	 But Hillary 's nomination was itself an offense against American political norms and an incredibly reckless act . 
1	222	 And the Democrats were supposed to be the party acting rationally . 
1	222	 Clinton effectively locked up the nomination in June and was n't cleared of criminal wrongdoing by the FBI until July . 
1	222	 What if she had been indicted ? 
1	222	 Would Democrats have run her anyway ? 
1	222	 Would they have substituted in a 74-year - old socialist who had lost the nomination battle , or someone else who had n't even run ? 
1	222	 Any of these circumstances would have been unprecedented , but Democrats risked it . 
1	222	 They did it , in part , because they could never bring themselves to fully acknowledge the seriousness of the email scandal and , relatedly , the ethical miasma around the Clinton Foundation . 
1	222	 They considered it all another desperate trick of the Vast Right - Wing Conspiracy . 
1	222	 Clinton henchman David Brock demanded that the New York Times retract its initial report of Clinton 's exclusive use of a private email account in March 2015 . 
1	222	" A parade of Democratic operatives pooh - poohed the whole thing , from Clinton spokesman Karen Finney ( "" a politically motivated series of attacks "" ) to James Carville ( "" not going to amount to a hill of beans "" ) to Howard Dean ( "" hooey "" ) . "
1	222	 When they first got on a debate stage together last October , Bernie Sanders , the only man who had a chance to stop Clinton , pleased the crowd with a ringing denunciation of interest in her emails . 
1	222	 Democrats bought the just - so stories offered up by the Clinton campaign . 
1	222	" The FBI investigation was just a "" security review . "" "
1	222	 The FBI was n't investigating Hillary , but only her server . 
1	222	 Anything to deflect from the seriousness of the matter . 
1	222	 While Democrats willfully looked the other way , they put Comey in an impossible position . 
1	222	 An indictment would change the course of American history . 
1	222	 That was all on him . 
1	222	 He ultimately blinked . 
1	222	 But he also put on the record the recklessness of Clinton 's practices as secretary of state in an attempt to create public accountability . 
1	222	 Comey 's conduct is open to criticism , but there 's no way to please everyone when handling a case with such high political stakes . 
1	222	 His notification to Congress last weekend is another case in point . 
1	222	 All that can be said is that if Democrats did n't want the FBI to have any part in the election , they could 've considered that before nominating Clinton . 
1	222	 Trump may be a deeply flawed candidate , but he caught a wave of popular fervor ; Hillary , with her astonishing vulnerabilities , is a production of the Democratic elites who did everything to get her over the finish line . 
1	222	 Just how vulnerable is she ? 
1	222	" If it were n't for the new trove of Huma Abedin emails , the blockbuster news this week would come via a Wall Street Journal report that the FBI is investigating the Clinton Foundation — although Fox News reported the same thing at the beginning of the year , and Hillary , of course , dismissed it as an "" unsourced and irresponsible claim that has no basis . "" "
1	222	 The email scandal and Clinton Foundation will dog Hillary until Election Day and , should she win , into her presidency .

1	227	"Politics share tweet tweet "" They are so blinded by their victim narrative that they do n't recognize that his very protest was actually an insult to the flag . "" "
1	227	 Colin Kaepernick continues to be in the news , though recently it is largely for what he is n't doing . 
1	227	 He was released from the San Francisco 49ers earlier this year , and he has yet to find work despite several tantalizing openings due to roster upheaval and injuries on other teams . 
1	227	 This is because many NFL owners and fans did not like how he kneeled for the national anthem . 
1	227	 They viewed it as a self - indulgent and disrespectful act that politicized what should have been a nonpolitical event . 
1	227	 But , showing their continued march towards irrelevancy , left leaning commentators like Ryan Clark on ESPN 's Mike and Mike show are now saying Kaepernick is a victim . 
1	227	" Without a hint of irony , Clark said that Kaepernick was the "" flag bearer "" for blacks in America and the NFL . "
1	227	 But in order to use that analogy , a person would have to actually respect the flag , and this in turn undermines the narrative that liberals and activists are peddling . 
1	227	 The narrative from activists , race hucksters , and many politicians is that blacks are disproportionately targeted by cops and the judicial system . 
1	227	 That they are victims of systemic poverty that leads to crime , and that the root causes and issues that are important to them are not being addressed . 
1	227	 This narrative is n't wholly disconnected from reality , but it 's twisted into an overtly political narrative that often undermines meaningful reform . 
1	227	 Flag bearers are important in history because they often represent the focal point of command and control . 
1	227	 The flag was usually close to the commander , and the flag moving forward on the battlefield could communicate an attack when it was too loud for words . 
1	227	 It was an honorable tradition to carry the flag , and the enemy often aimed for the flag bearer , which made it the most dangerous spot on the battlefield . 
1	227	 Raising the flag on Iwo Jima became one of America 's most cherished memorials , and seeing the flag through a nightly bombardment supplied our national anthem . 
1	227	 No compatible source was found for this video . 
1	227	 The importance of the flag does n't seem lost on Ryan Clarke and other analysts when they compare Kaepernick to a flag bearer . 
1	227	 This makes their use of that analogy all the more tone deaf . 
1	227	 They are so blinded by their victim narrative that they do n't recognize that his very protest was actually an insult to the flag . 
1	227	 It 's tougher to find people more removed from the poor and supposedly discriminated members of inner cities than professional athletes . 
1	227	 Acting macho and street tough is part of their persona , but it 's just as authentic as professional wrestling . 
1	227	 These athletes are part of the one percent , who make more money than most Americans and play in taxpayer subsidized stadiums while getting special treatment . 
1	227	 I ca n't think of an individual more unsuited to lead the supposed civil rights crusade for blacks than a pampered 1 % athlete . 
1	227	 But with a black President , Secretary of State , and Supreme Court Justice , it 's tough to argue that racism is worse now than in the past when athletes stood and honored the flag . 
1	227	 If Ryan Clarke and other liberal sports analysts want to praise the act of kneeling for the anthem , they should avoid using analogies that underscore the importance of the flag .ESPN Analyst Says Former San Fran Quarterback Colin Kaepernick Is the Victim

1	232	Politicians are trying to deceive you . 
1	232	 Modern ( American ) politics is essentially a game in which politicians say and do whatever they possibly can to persuade people that they are an ideal leader deserving of a vote . 
1	232	 But you already know that . 
1	232	 Hopefully . 
1	232	 Most of us are pretty cynical about politics and straight - up expect politicians to lie to us . 
1	232	 We understand that posturing , over - promising , tricky rhetoric , and psychological manipulation are par for the course in the political arena . 
1	232	 Interestingly , though , I 've been hearing some claims regarding the current presidential race that contradict the typical cynicism with which most people view political candidates . 
1	232	 Specifically , I 've heard many people expressing the belief that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are refreshingly different from typical political candidates . 
1	232	 Why ? 
1	232	 Because they say what they really feel and think , supposedly . 
1	232	 They are n't just talking heads . 
1	232	 They 're real people who will let their real views and ideas be known , for better or worse . 
1	232	 That might be true , to some extent . 
1	232	 Trump and Sanders might be more authentic than most politicians ( which would n't take much ) . 
1	232	 It 's almost impossible to say . 
1	232	 The Truth 
1	232	 But even if they are , make no mistake : They are still playing the game like everyone else . 
1	232	 I 'm not saying anything about their merits as candidates or people , and I 'm not making any kind of moral judgment . 
1	232	 I 'm just saying that they too are posturing , over - promising , and employing tricky rhetoric and psychological tactics to win over their audiences . 
1	232	 Do n't think for a second that they 're not . 
1	232	 No one would have a prayer of winning a presidential race without doing those things . 
1	232	 But people are viewing them as utterly genuine . 
1	232	 People are taking them at face value . 
1	232	 Sanders has this effect on people because he 's so fiercely passionate about the issues . 
1	232	 I actually believe he sincerely cares about the things he wants to change , and so he exudes an earnestness while speaking that captivates many people , especially people in my generation . 
1	232	 Nonetheless , I assure you that Sanders is self - aware of his grandiose , fiery style and his calls for revolution . 
1	232	 He knows he 's over - promising , and he 's consciously trying to create a tsunami of unrealistically high hope for a better world and ride that wave into the White House , like Obama did . 
1	232	 It 's a good strategy , though if he gets elected , many people will probably be upset when the revolution does n't arrive , when the billionaire class continues to exist , and when big money continues to influence politics.¹ 
1	232	 Trump , on the other hand , is perceived as honest because he says and does so many ludicrous things , compared to traditional candidates . 
1	232	 Trump 's behavior is so ridiculous that people ca n't fathom that most of it could be an act , a strategy , a role he 's learned to play . 
1	232	 But it is . 
1	232	 And whereas Bernie is trying to ride a wave of hope into the White House , Trump is trying to ride a wave of fear and anger . 
1	232	 Trump 's appeal is downright frightening because we are at a rather precarious moment in the history of the United States and the history of the world . 
1	232	 The planet is filled with nuclear warheads ; environmental crises are occurring / looming ; the largest refugee crisis since World War II is taking place . 
1	232	 The 21st century is a time in which the countries of the world need more than ever to cooperate with one another , consider a global perspective , and devise strategies that will make the human enterprise sustainable through the 21st century and hopefully far beyond . 
1	232	 But Trump is n't much of a cooperator . 
1	232	" He 's explicitly stated that he wants to build a wall around much of the United States , and he 's made comments that reveal a frighteningly uncritical and violent approach to international relations ( on ISIS : "" I would bomb the shit out of ' em , "" and "" … you have to take out their families . "" ) . "
1	232	 From my vantage point , a leader like Trump is more likely to help bring about World War III than a more sustainable , equitable , and unified human enterprise.² 
1	232	 Many people do n't see it this way , though . 
1	232	 Many believe that Trump 's aggressive and America - centric approach to politics will be our saving grace . 
1	232	 This may have something to do with the hypothesized psychological divide between people who lean Left versus people who lean Right . 
1	232	 Some fascinating studies have suggested that there are neurobiological differences between liberals and conservatives . 
1	232	 One study found , for instance , that conservatives tend to respond to threatening situations with more aggression than liberals . 
1	232	 If one wanted to appeal to conservative - minded people , it follows then that one could paint a picture of the world as One Giant Threat to America and propose an extremely aggressive plan to ameliorate the situation . 
1	232	 As we 'll see , Donald Trump is a master of this persuasive tactic . 
1	232	 He 's a master of a number of other tactics as well , and the cumulative effect of these tactics is that he 's gone from being considered a joke candidate to having a decent chance of becoming the next leader of one of the most powerful countries in the world . 
1	232	 12 Psychological Tactics That Make Donald Trump a Master Manipulator 
1	232	 Let 's take a closer look at the various tactics Trump has used to climb into his present position . 
1	232	 The following points were gathered primarily from two YouTube videos³ created by Charlie Houpert , which provide an excellent analysis of Trump 's various psychological strategies . 
1	232	 You 'll find the videos embedded at the bottom of this article , if you 'd like to watch them , but that is n't necessary , as I 'll thoroughly summarize the 12 strategies they discuss . 
1	232	 1 . 
1	232	 Sowing Seeds of Fear Wiki Commons 
1	232	" Trump has said , "" You 're going to have more World Trade Centers . "
1	232	" It 's going to get worse and worse , folks , "" and "" When Mexico sends its people , they 're not sending their best . "
1	232	 They 're bringing drugs ; they 're bringing crime ; they 're rapists . 
1	232	" And some , I assume , are good people . "" "
1	232	 These are blatant instances of fear - mongering . 
1	232	 Trump deliberately hones in on frightening statistical rarities — terrorist attacks against the US and immigrants who are dangerous rapists — and acts like they 've become the norm . 
1	232	 Violence has actually declined over recent decades and centuries , but Trump makes it seem like the opposite has happened . 
1	232	 Why does he do this ? 
1	232	 Charlie Houpert , the creator of the videos I mentioned , explains it well : 
1	232	" "" Fear is an incredibly powerful emotion . "
1	232	 It captures our attention like no other emotion can . 
1	232	 We focus intensely on the thing that is giving us that fear . 
1	232	 Secondly , it shuts down higher thinking . 
1	232	 When we 're terrified by a bump in the night , we do n't focus on the probability that it 's just the wind . 
1	232	 Our critical thinking skills dip as we focus solely on protecting ourselves . 
1	232	" Thirdly , it feels crappy , so the fastest way to get out of fear and move toward a powerful emotion is to move into anger . "" "
1	232	 Proven Winners Visit Site 
1	232	 Major news outlets portray the world as a terrifying place because doing so captures people 's attention . 
1	232	 Trump is doing the same thing . 
1	232	 Fear ensnares our attention like nothing else can , while simultaneously short - circuiting our higher cognitive functioning . 
1	232	 This is unsettling because our natural response to fear is to escape or destroy whatever is threatening us as quickly as possible . 
1	232	 It is quite natural for humans to cope with fear by becoming angry and aggressive . 
1	232	 Trump fuels this fire of fear - driven rage and hostility as much as he possibly can and directs it toward non - American outgroups . 
1	232	" He says things like "" China is taking our jobs ; they 're taking our money , "" and "" Syrians are now being caught at the Southern border ; we do n't know who they are ; could be ISIS . "" "
1	232	 He sets up false dichotomies between the interests of Americans and the interests of other humans of the world , such that if you disagree with him , you appear to be anti - American . 
1	232	 This leaves many credulous viewers with one obvious response : to be an angry , aggressive , Trump - supporting American who views the rest of the world with suspicion and aggression ! 
1	232	" This potent combination of fear- , anger- , and aggression - mongering then sets Trump up for one of his most effective lies : that he is the only big , strong man tough enough to do what needs to be done to kick everyone else 's ass and "" make America great again . "" "
1	232	" Trump makes unrealistic claims such as "" No one else will keep you safe , "" and "" No one is going to mess with us . "" "
1	232	 He presents himself as the most dominant and strongest - willed candidate — the only candidate capable of returning the US to its rightful position as Imminent , Dominant Global Superpower . 
1	232	 But again , do we need America to dominate other countries / entities at this point in history ? 
1	232	 It 's likely that some amount of military action is advisable , as certain groups ( e.g. ISIS ) are committing brutal crimes against innocent people . 
1	232	 However , if one looks at the bigger picture , it becomes clear that cooperation rather than conflict must become the rule in the human enterprise , if the human species is to persist into the deep future . 
1	232	 On a planet now laced with nuclear warheads , unbounded aggression is no longer an option . 
1	232	 And in a biosphere facing various environmental crises , our species must recognize the collective goal of devising sustainable systems to avert catastrophe . 
1	232	 But , as I mentioned earlier , research has suggested that conservative - minded people respond more aggressively to threatening situations than liberal - minded people . 
1	232	 Instinctively aggressive people respond favorably to Trump 's call for a return to an Ultra - Dominant America . 
1	232	" That some people are more instinctively aggressive than others is not a "" bad "" thing . "
1	232	 Clearly , this arrangement was beneficial in our primal past , or we would not have evolved this way . 
1	232	 However , we do n't live in the world of our distant ancestors anymore . 
1	232	 We live in a world in which excessive aggression / conflict is a potential threat to the entire biosphere and all sentient life . 
1	232	 Thus , we need leaders who are capable of taking calculated aggressive measures after a thorough analysis of all available courses of action , not leaders whose default response to problematic circumstances is to use hyper - aggressive military force , as Trump wishes to do . 
1	232	 The world is a damn complex and ambiguous place , but admitting this reality is not a good political strategy . 
1	232	 It 's much more effective to paint the world as a simple place where things are either X or not - X. To do so is to commit the ‘ false dilemma ' fallacy . 
1	232	 A quintessential example is a much - cited statement made by George W. Bush in 2001 : 
1	232	" "" Either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists . "" "
1	232	 It comforts people to tell them that things must be either this or that because it makes them feel that they understand the insanely complex bramble of global affairs that no individual human actually understands en toto . 
1	232	 Trump is brilliant at reducing the complexity of the world to black - and - white narratives . 
1	232	 One of his favorites is the narrative of Winners vs Losers . 
1	232	 In Trump 's story , America has been unambiguously losing in recent memory ; America is becoming a perma - loser before our eyes , and we 're just getting used to it . 
1	232	 Wiki Commons 
1	232	" Of course , with Trump as president , America is going to start winning again in all regards . "" "
1	232	" We 're going to start winning so much that you 're going to get used to winning instead of getting used to losing , "" he has said . "
1	232	" Does it even make sense to conceive of individual countries as "" winners "" or "" losers "" in a world where the future of our entire species and all life on Earth is potentially at stake ? "
1	232	 Probably not . 
1	232	 Yet Trump 's black - and - white narrative appeals to our desire for simple , digestible stories and our American hyper - competitiveness . 
1	232	 And again , when people are afraid and angry , they are primed to accept whatever convenient narrative promises to allow them to escape their fear , and thus the absurdly vague and reductive America is Going to Start Winning So Much Again That We 'll Have Nothing to Worry About story begins to seem quite alluring indeed . 
1	232	 One downside of portraying yourself as the Big Strong Man is that there will still always be situations in which someone gets the best of you , making you appear foolish or weak . 
1	232	 Donald Trump has found himself in this situation on a number of occasions . 
1	232	" One of the most notable was a situation in which Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly confronted Trump about past comments in which Trump had called women he disliked "" fat pigs , dogs , slobs , and disgusting animals . "" "
1	232	" This question was a potential landmine for Trump , but he interrupted Megyn Kelly halfway through her question by saying , "" Only Rosie O'Donnell . "" "
1	232	 This comment caused an uproar of laughter in the audience and all but derailed the inquiry into Trump 's juvenile and dehumanizing remarks . 
1	232	 Trump has perfected this strategy of deflecting potential threats through the use of humor . 
1	232	 As Charlie Houpert put it : 
1	232	" "" So that is the power of laughter . "
1	232	 It is a pattern interrupt[ion ] . 
1	232	 You ca n't stay booing and upset and angry when somebody makes you uncontrollably laugh . 
1	232	 It also makes you more receptive to whatever comes next that somebody has to say because they 've already started to lead you emotionally . 
1	232	 So what Donald Trump is doing is using laughter to take control of situations where he 's starting to lose control . 
1	232	" And what that does for him is it effectively helps him dodge any points that you make against him because he can almost erase them with a laughing crowd . "" "
1	232	 Humor is n't Trump 's only strategy for avoiding discussion of some of the more contentious issues in his record . 
1	232	 Another favorite strategy of his is to simply act superior to all opponents and criticisms . 
1	232	 In one of the GOP debates , Jeb Bush attempted to point out that Donald Trump had completely changed his stance on ISIS in a matter of two months . 
1	232	 As Jeb was saying this , Trump did n't even pay him the courtesy of looking in his direction . 
1	232	" Instead , he looked only at the audience with an expression of disbelief and disgust that said , "" Who is this guy ? "" "
1	232	 This maneuver indicates to the audience that Bush 's attack is ridiculous , laughable , not even worthy of attention , allowing Trump to bypass any sort of rational discussion . 
1	232	 By contrast , when Trump attacked Bush , Bush looked directly at Trump with an expression of distress and disconcertedness , playing perfectly into Trump 's game . 
1	232	 Jeb appeared to be something of a confused and insecure novice looking to Big Daddy Trump for answers . 
1	232	 This point is related to the previous two , but it deserves emphasis . 
1	232	 Trump 's power plays — whether making jokes in the face of criticism or acting superior to other candidates — are all aimed at making him appear as the leader of a game in which everyone else is merely a player . 
1	232	" In social dynamics , this is referred to as "" frame control . "" "
1	232	 Trump frames every interaction as if he is unquestionably superior to those around him , as if everyone else is in his world . 
1	232	 When it comes to politics , whichever politician has the strongest and most unflinching frame will make that frame a perceived reality . 
1	232	 And Trump is very good at unflinchingly selling his frame . 
1	232	 As a billionaire , thick - skinned businessman , he 's been practicing this tactic for decades . 
1	232	 Combine this with his fear - mongering , anger - mongering , and presenting himself as the One Great Strong Solution to Loser America , and you 've got a potent combination of factors coming together to make Donald Trump appear to be an untouchable , iron - willed leader in comparison to his opponents . 
1	232	 Another of Trump 's favorite tactics ( and another form of frame control ) is to trap other candidates in double - bind situations . 
1	232	 Essentially , this means that he puts them in positions where it does n't matter what they say or how they react to him — however they respond , he will come out looking better and they will come out looking worse . 
1	232	 Charlie Houpert cites the example of Trump taunting Jeb Bush about having low energy during one of the GOP debates . 
1	232	" Trump says , "" I know you 're trying to build up your energy , Jeb , but it 's not working . "" "
1	232	 In the face of such a statement , Jeb Bush has two options : to try to ratchet his energy up or keep it where it is / take it down a notch . 
1	232	 If he chooses the former , he appears to be reacting to Trump , making Trump look like he 's in control . 
1	232	 If he chooses the latter , he remains low - energy and Trump can just steamroll him throughout the debate . 
1	232	 It 's a lose - lose situation for Jeb Bush , and this is the power of a double - bind . 
1	232	" Donald Trump repeats emotionally provocative words like "" strong "" and "" win "" over and over and over . "
1	232	" The second of Charlie Houpert 's videos shows one absurd clip in which Trump manages to say the word "" win "" 12 times in about 15 seconds . "
1	232	 This tactic subtly conditions people to associate strength and victory with the Trump campaign . 
1	232	 You might think that this tactic is silly or would only be effective on unintelligent people , but you 'd be wrong . 
1	232	 There 's a reason large companies pour millions of dollars into ad campaigns with catchy taglines and jingles : through sheer repetition , certain associations become embedded in the mind , if only on an unconscious level . 
1	232	 Watch the documentary Century of the Self sometime if you do n't believe me . 
1	232	 Trump loves to hammer social proof . 
1	232	 He repeats over and over and over that he 's ahead in the polls or that people agree he won a particular debate . 
1	232	 As social creatures , we have a distinct and sometimes malignant tendency to do and believe whatever we think everyone else is doing and believing . 
1	232	 Trump understands the importance of this fact , and so at every turn , he acts as if he has an army of people behind him . 
1	232	 Trump is also very careful to avoid negative social proof . 
1	232	" For instance , at one point Trump appeared on the O'Reilly Factor , and Bill O'Reilly suggested that people had seen Trump as a "" buffoon "" when he first announced his campaign . "
1	232	 Trump outright rejected this statement , acted as if it was outrageous , and assured the audience that people did not feel that way . 
1	232	 He was very deliberate and forceful about this because he knows that what people think other people think is one of the most potent forces driving human belief and behavior . 
1	232	 His decades in business almost certainly ingrained that lesson into his mind . 
1	232	 Trump loves to assert that authority figures approve of him and disapprove of other candidates . 
1	232	" The second video of Charlie Houpert 's cites Trump saying , "" Larry Kudlow likes my tax plan , "" and "" Experts wonder if Cruz can run the US because he was born in Canada . "" "
1	232	 Trump understands that especially in our uncertain postmodern world with its endless sources of competing information , people look to experts to form their opinions . 
1	232	 There is also a cognitive bias known as the Asch effect that is relevant here . 
1	232	 From Wikipedia : 
1	232	" "" In repeated and modified instances of the Asch conformity experiments , it was found that high - status individuals create a stronger likelihood of a subject agreeing with an obviously false conclusion , despite the subject normally being able to clearly see that the answer was incorrect . "
1	232	 So not only do we tend to feel pressure to conform with the herd , but we also feel pressure to agree with high - status individuals . 
1	232	 Here 's an off - the - cuff armchair - evolutionary - psych explanation for this phenomenon : When our ancestors lived as bands of hunter - gatherers , it was beneficial to have an extraordinary level of cohesion of belief and action in a given tribe ; it was often a matter of life or death . 
1	232	 Thus , tribes in which people unquestioningly accepted the worldview passed on by wise elders and readily conformed to the herd mentality would be more likely to survive . 
1	232	 Anyway , for whatever reason , we 're much more likely to believe something if an authority figure or expert tells us it 's true . 
1	232	 Trump understands this and takes advantage of it at every turn . 
1	232	 This might come as a surprise , but humans actually suck at making rational decisions and are much more likely to make emotion - driven decisions . 
1	232	 This is a great thing a lot of the time because in many areas of life , our emotions and feelings are excellent indicators of an appropriate course of action . 
1	232	 But when it comes to choosing the leader of one of the most powerful countries in the world , it might be a bad idea to vote for a guy because his smile gives you the warm fuzzies . 
1	232	 Unfortunately , it 's damn difficult for humans to use rationality , especially if they have n't been trained to think critically or have n't researched the various cognitive biases that result in inaccurate thinking . 
1	232	 Donald Trump knows that most people make their decisions on the basis of emotion rather than reason . 
1	232	 He also knows that there are certain methods of manipulating people 's emotions to get them to do what you want . 
1	232	 Most all of the items on this list — from fear-/anger - mongering and deflection via humor to repetition , social proof , and appeal to authority — are effective methods of making people feel very confident about a position , despite the fact that they have n't considered any statistical evidence or rational arguments . 
1	232	 Donald Trump understands this , and that 's why you 'll never see him engaging in a rational discussion of the issues or of the criticisms levied against him . 
1	232	 When challenged to do so , Trump will deflect via humor , appeal to vague authorities or social proof , or utilize some sort of half - relevant anecdote to appeal to emotion and distract from his shortcomings . 
1	232	 As I said before , Donald Trump is n't the only one playing the manipulation game . 
1	232	 Other candidates also understand that people are emotional creatures , and any candidate who wants to have a chance of winning must use some or all of these tactics . 
1	232	 Such is the nature of American democracy in 2016 . 
1	232	 What 's frightening about Trump is that he 's so damn good at playing this game . 
1	232	 He 's spent decades learning the subtle art of being a dominant social presence and persuading people to do what he wants them to do . 
1	232	 His actual values and ideas could be egregiously ill - conceived . 
1	232	 Hell , they could be a recipe for World War III . 
1	232	 But because he 's such a talented hypnotist politician , his actual values and ideas do n't matter that much . 
1	232	 If he wins the race , it will be because he effectively encouraged and harnessed the fear , anger , and emotion - driven decision - making of a large portion of the American public . 
1	232	 Personally , I would prefer not to find out what happens to America after electing one of the most effective fear- and anger - mongers since , uh , Adolf Hitler . 
1	232	 I would prefer not to find out if a man who has spent the last 30 years plastering his name on everything he could put his name on gives two shits about the interests of most Americans . 
1	232	 I would prefer not to find out if a businessman with no political experience is prepared to approach the challenges of the presidency with wisdom and acumen . 
1	232	 I would prefer not to find out if Trump 's hard - ass , violence - friendly approach to political problems is as dangerous for planet Earth as I think it is . 
1	232	 If you found this article educational or important in any way , please pass it on to your friends . 
1	232	 1 . 
1	232	 Do n't get me wrong : I like Bernie and would likely vote for him if he were to get the nomination . 
1	232	 All I 'm saying is that he 's playing the game too , and that in reality , he had no choice but to play the game if he wanted to have any chance of winning . 
1	232	 2 . 
1	232	 One could also argue that an extremely passive or pacifistic US President could inadvertently cause a World - War - III situation by failing to take action to neutralize dangerous groups or leaders who are gaining power . 
1	232	 Some argue that this is essentially what happened pre - World War II . 
1	232	 My view is that we need leaders who are capable of taking aggressive measures after a thorough analysis of all available courses of action , not leaders whose default response to problematic circumstances is to use hyper - aggressive military force .

1	239	Damon Winter / The New York Times 
1	239	 Donald Trump has virtually stopped trying to win this election by any conventional metric and is instead stacking logs of grievance on the funeral pyre with the great anticipation of setting it ablaze if current polls turn out to be predictive . 
1	239	 There is something calamitous in the air that surrounds the campaign , a hostile fatalism that bespeaks a man convinced that the end is near and aiming his anger at all within reach . 
1	239	 As his path to victory grows narrower , his desperation grows more pronounced . 
1	239	 Last week a steady stream of women stepped forward to accuse Trump of some form of sexual assault , abuse or inappropriate behavior . 
1	239	 Trump 's response has been marked by a stunning lack of grace and dignity , let alone contrition or empathy , a response much like the man himself . 
1	239	 Instead , he is doubling down on sexism . 
1	239	" On Thursday , Trump said of the People magazine reporter who accused him of forcibly kissing her : "" Look at her . "
1	239	 Look at her words . 
1	239	 You tell me what you think . 
1	239	" I do n't think so . "" "
1	239	" He said on Friday of the woman accusing him of groping her on an airplane : "" Believe me , she would not be my first choice , that I can tell you . "" "
1	239	" He also said of Clinton , "" When she walked in front of me , believe me , I was n't impressed . "" "
1	239	 His response to these charges has been surprisingly — and perhaps , revealingly — callow . 
1	239	 He has mocked , whined , chided , bemoaned and belittled . 
1	239	 It 's as if the man is on a mission to demonstrate to voters the staggering magnitude of his social vulgarity and emotional ineptitude . 
1	239	 He has dispensed with all semblances of wanting to appear presidential and embraced what seems to be most natural to him : acting like a pig . 
1	239	 Furthermore , everything is rigged against him , from the media to the election itself . 
1	239	 He 's threatening to sue The New York Times . 
1	239	 He says he and Clinton should take a drug test before the next debate . 
1	239	 These are the ravings of a lunatic . 
1	239	 Trump is back to carelessly shooting off his mouth and recklessly shooting himself in the foot . 
1	239	 It is sad , really , but for him I have no sympathy . 
1	239	 He has spent this entire election attacking anyone and everyone whom he felt it would be politically advantageous to attack . 
1	239	 Trump , now that you 're under attack , you want to cry woe - is - me and have people commiserate . 
1	239	 Slim chance , big guy . 
1	239	 The coarseness of your character has been put on full display , and now the electorate has come to cash the check you wrote . 
1	239	 Trump now looks like a madman from Mad Men , a throwback to when his particular privileges had more perks and were considered less repugnant . 
1	239	 He looks pathetic . 
1	239	 He is a ball of contradictions that together form a bully , a man who has built a menacing wall around the hollow of his self . 
1	239	 He is brash to mask his fragility . 
1	239	 But in a way , Trump was authentically made in America . 
1	239	 America has a habit of romanticizing the playboy as much as the cowboy , but there is often something untoward about the playboy , unseemly , predatory and broken . 
1	239	 For years , Trump built a reputation on shuffling through women , treating his exploits with jocularity and having too much of America smiling in amusement at the bad boy antics . 
1	239	 But he 's not a kid ; he 's a cad . 
1	239	" And he seems constitutionally incapable of processing the idea that wealth is not completely immunizing , that some rules are universally applicable , that common decency is required of more than just "" common "" folks . "
1	239	 He seems genuinely offended that he should be held to the same standards of truth , decorum and even law as those less well off . 
1	239	 Trump is in fact the logical extension of toxic masculinity and ambient misogyny . 
1	239	 He is the logical extension of rampant racism . 
1	239	 He is the logical extension of wealth worship . 
1	239	 He is the logical extension of pervasive anti - intellectualism . 
1	239	 Trump is the logical extension of the worst of America . 
1	239	 With him you get a man who believes himself superior in every way : through the gift of fortune and the happenstance of chromosomes . 
1	239	 He believes the rules simply do n't apply . 
1	239	 Not rules that govern the sovereignty of another 's body , not rules that dictate decorousness . 
1	239	 And the Republican Party was just the right place for him to park himself . 
1	239	 When you have a political party that takes as its mission to prevent government from working instead of to make government work , a party that conflates the ill effects of a changing economy with the changing complexion of the country and is still struck by fever over the election of President Obama , Trump is a natural , predictable endpoint . 
1	239	 Furthermore , Trump is what happens when you wear your Christian conservative values like a cardigan to conveniently slip off when the heat rises . 
1	239	 Trump is fundamentally altering American politics — coarsening them , corrupting them , cratering them . 
1	239	 And America , particularly conservative America , has only itself to blame . 
1	239	 Republicans sowed intolerance and in its shadow , Trump sprang up like toxic fungi .Donald Trump , the Worst of America
0	240	The rapidly - evolving story concerning the FBI 's renewed interest in Hillary Clinton 's email sever has a number of players . 
0	240	 Some are famous , others are not . 
0	240	 Here are some people involved in the latest political drama . 
0	240	 ANTHONY WEINER 
0	240	 Once a rising star in the Democratic Party , Weiner was an outspoken and telegenic congressman from the outer boroughs of New York City . 
0	240	 He married senior Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin in 2010 in a ceremony officiated by Bill Clinton , and was mentored by Sen. Chuck Schumer . 
0	240	 Then , in 2011 , he accidentally tweeted an explicit photo from himself , which eventually led to his resignation from Congress . 
0	240	 FILE - In this July 24 , 2013 file photo , New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner leaves his apartment building in New York . 
0	240	 He launched a comeback bid for Mayor of New York City in 2013 , and was briefly the frontrunner until it was revealed that he was still sending explicit photos to people other than his wife , sometimes under the pseudonym Carlos Danger . 
0	240	 Over this past summer , authorities opened an investigation into Weiner 's alleged sexting with an underage girl , which at one point included a picture of his young son . 
0	240	 Abedin announced that she was separating from Weiner in August , but the investigation eventually led to the discovery of a laptop containing thousands of emails potentially relating to the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton 's email server . 
0	240	 JAMES COMEY 
0	240	 Appointed FBI director in September 2013 by President Obama , Comey has a long and distinguished record in law enforcement , including a stint as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2002 to 2003 . 
0	240	 He then became a deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush until 2005 before leaving to accept a series of lucrative private sector jobs . 
0	240	 FBI Director James Comey makes a statement at FBI Headquarters in Washington , Tuesday , July 5 , 2016 . 
0	240	 A Republican for most of his life , Comey contributed to the presidential campaigns of both Sen. John McCain and Gov. Mitt Romney , but said in 2016 he was no longer registered with the GOP . 
0	240	 In July , he attracted criticism from Republicans for declining to recommend charges against Hillary Clinton over the use of her private email server , a decision he announced in a press conference . 
0	240	 Last week , he sent a letter to Congress notifying the chairs of relevant committees that the investigation had resumed due to information obtained during a separate investigation . 
0	240	 It was later revealed that FBI investigators looking into Anthony Weiner had found a laptop used by him and his wife , Huma Abedin , containing thousands of emails potentially going to - and - from Clinton 's private server . 
0	240	 ANDREW MCCABE 
0	240	 McCabe joined the FBI in 1996 , serving out of the New York field office and focusing on organized crime . 
0	240	 According to his official FBI biography , he has held senior positions in the counterterrorism and national security divisions , eventually becoming deputy director , the bureau 's second - in - command position , in February . 
0	240	 His wife , Jill McCabe , was an unsuccessful Democratic Virginia state senate candidate in 2015 , and received nearly $ 500,000 in campaign funds from Gov. Terry McAuliffe political action committee . 
0	240	 McAuliffe is a close Clinton ally , but Andrew McCabe still reportedly oversaw the wide - ranging investigation into Hillary Clinton 's private email server . 
0	240	 McCabe did , however , recuse himself from a separate investigation into McAuliffe due to his wife 's ties to the governor . 
0	240	 In early October , according to a report by The Wall Street Journal 's Devlin Barrett , agents investigating Anthony Weiner notified McCabe that a laptop had been discovered that could contain emails pertinent to the separate investigation of Hillary Clinton 's email server . 
0	240	 FBI investigators originally looked through the laptop looking for child pornography , and required another court order to look for emails relating to the server to - and - from Weiner 's wife , Clinton aide Huma Abedin . 
0	240	 JASON CHAFFETZ 
0	240	 The GOP chairman of the House Oversight Committee has been closely tracking the FBI 's investigation into Hillary Clinton 's use of private email servers as secretary of state . 
0	240	 On Friday , Chaffetz tweeted that FBI Director James Comey had learned about new emails pertinent to its investigation into Clinton . 
0	240	 Comey had sent him and other Republican committee chairmen on Capitol Hill a vague letter about the discovery . 
0	240	 Chaffetz said that the case had been reopened .

0	240	" Before the development , Chaffetz told The Washington Post last week that he planned to spend "" years "" investigating Clinton . "
0	240	 JILL MCCABE 
0	240	 Despite never running for office before , McCabe launched a campaign last year to run for a state Senate seat in Virginia . 
0	240	 She is the wife of FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe who , has been overseeing the investigation into Hillary Clinton 's use of private email servers when she led the State Department . 
0	240	 Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe , a former top aide to the Clintons , reportedly recruited McCabe for the seat in an effort to tip the balance of the state Senate . 
0	240	 While she was recruited around the time that The New York Times broke the Clinton emails story , the FBI did n't launch its investigation into it until July 2015 and Andrew McCabe was n't promoted to his current role until earlier this year . 
0	240	 McAuliffe 's political action committee donated nearly $ 500,000 to Jill McCabe 's campaign , which was unsuccessful . 
0	240	 Chaffetz asked Andrew McCabe last week to provide documents about his wife 's Senate campaign amid questions about a possible conflict of interest . 
0	240	 Huma Abedin 
0	240	 The emails being reviewed by the FBI were found on laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner in the course of a separate investigation into Huma Abedin 's now - estranged husband , Anthony Weiner . 
0	240	 He was allegedly sexting with a 15-year - old girl in North Carolina . 
0	240	" Abedin was said to be "" surprised "" by the emails on the computer , and during her interview with the FBI , she said she had given up all relevant electronic devices used for emails relating to her work for Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state . "
0	240	 After an earlier sexting scandal over the summer , Abedin announced she was separating from Weiner . 
0	240	 Abedin was deputy chief of staff for Clinton but served in the capacity of a consultant , rather than as State Department staff . 
0	240	 During this time , she also consulted for Teneo , a strategic consulting firm founded by a former Bill Clinton aide , Doug Band , and for the Clinton Foundation . 
0	240	 Her overlapping jobs have been at the center of questions about whether Clinton 's State Department was too close to the Clinton Foundation and to Teneo . 
0	240	" Abedin has been called the Clintons ' "" second daughter "" -- Bill Clinton even officiated at her 2010 wedding to Weiner . "
0	240	 She was born in Michigan to Saudi intellectuals and was subsequently raised in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia . 
0	240	 She returned to the U.S. for college and became an intern for Clinton in 1996 , who was first lady at the time . 
0	240	 She has served as traveling chief of staff and senior adviser to Clinton , as well . 
0	240	 TERRY MCAULIFFE 
0	240	 A close Clinton ally and former chair of the Democratic National Committee , McAulifee was elected Virginia governor in 2013 . 
0	240	 McAuliffe 's PAC donated nearly $ 500,000 to the Virginia state senate election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe , the wife of FBI official Andrew McCabe . 
0	240	 According to The Wall Street Journal , McCabe oversaw the investigation into Hillary Clinton 's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state . 
0	240	 At the same time , the Virginia Democratic Party contributed another $ 207,778 in the form of mailers to McCabe . 
0	240	" The Virginia governor responded to insinuations by Republicans that his PAC 's donation to McCabe was an attempt to influence the FBI . "" "
0	240	" I think we 're in silly season , "" he told WTVR last week . "
0	240	" The only time he met her husband , Andrew McCabe , was on Mar. 7 , he said : "" It was about Jill , highly qualified , she 's a medical doctor , and she 's a community leader . "
0	240	" That 's why we were supporting her . "" "
0	240	 McCabe ultimately lost the election to incumbent GOP State Sen. Dick Black .

0	240	 The FBI is also investigating the propriety of some donations to McAuliffe 's own 2013 gubernatorial campaign , including one by Chinese businessman , Wang Wenliang , CNN reported . 
0	240	 Wang was born in China but is a permanent U.S. resident , which could make him eligible to make campaign contributions . 
0	240	 McAuliffe 's friendship with both Clintons goes back to Bill Clinton 's presidency -- he was one of Clinton 's top fundraisers and later went on to chair the DNC . 
0	240	 When the Clintons were short of money after they left the White House burdened by legal debt , it was McAuliffe who secured the loan with $ 1.35 million of his own money , the New York Times ' Adam Nagourney reported at the time ( they paid him back soon after ) . 
0	240	 And the Clintons were big supporters of both his gubernatorial bids .Who 's who in the FBI email investigation ?

1	243	 Early Thursday , the controversial Milwaukee County Sheriff , David Clarke resigned without any notice . 
1	243	 The move was a surprising one but we should have known that President Trump had something to do with it . 
1	243	 The former Wisconsin sheriff gave his resignation on Thursday to join the Trump administration . 
1	243	 While Clarke submitted his letter of resignation Thursday afternoon , the letter did not include the details of why he quit and what was next for the sheriff . 
1	243	 However , CNN reports that Clarke will join the Trump administration but what exactly he will be doing is still unknown . 
1	243	 Trump has pegged him earlier this year for a role , but Clarke withdrew from consideration within a few days of the announcement . 
1	243	" According to CNN : "" It 's unclear what job Clarke will take in the administration , but one of the sources said he 's expected to join the White House . "

1	245	" "" To fear the world we have organized and led for three - quarters of a century , to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe , to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain ‘ the last best hope of Earth ' for the sake of some half - baked , spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history , "" John McCain said at the National Constitution Center .

0	249	 The early voting period in Florida has come to an end , and the final results are now in . 
0	249	 Early voting in Florida began on October 24th , and it concluded on November 6th . 
0	249	 According to data released by the Florida Department of State 's Division of Elections , 6.4 million Floridians voted early this year . 
0	249	 In the end , the Democrats were able to come away from early voting with the advantage . 
0	249	 A total of 2,558,000 votes were cast by registered Democrats , and 2,471,000 votes were cast by registered Republicans . 
0	249	 This translates into 39.85 percent of the vote going to the Democrats , and 38.49 percent of it going to the Republicans . 
0	249	 In total , 49.7 percent of the state 's entire population of registered voters have already voted . 
0	249	 This turnout of 6.4 million voters is a significant increase compared to four years ago , when only 4.4 million votes were cast early . 
0	249	 The Democrats hold a lead going into Election Day , but their lead is significantly smaller than it was four years ago . 
0	249	 In 2012 , Democrats scored 43 percent of the early vote in Florida , and Republicans scored 40 percent . 
0	249	 In the end , Barack Obama won Florida , but it was a tight race , with the president defeating Mitt Romney by a margin of just 0.88 percentage points . 
0	249	 Democratic turnout tends to be high in early voting , and Republican turnout tends to be high on Election Day . 
0	249	 So the fact that the Democrats do n't have as large a lead as they did four years ago may spell trouble for Hillary Clinton . 
0	249	 This year , about 1.2 million of the ballots cast came from those not affiliated with any of the two major parties . 
0	249	 This translates into 19.2 percent of the early vote . 
0	249	 It 's unclear who these voters selected , but many polls have suggested that they tend to gravitate towards Donald Trump . 
0	249	 In a recent CBS News poll , independent voters favored Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton , 47 percent to 34 percent , and another Remington Research survey showed Trump winning among unaffiliated voters 49 percent to 36 percent . 
0	249	 Although the number of votes cast by Democrats is down , good news for Hillary Clinton is the fact that Hispanic turnout in Florida is up this year . 
0	249	 According to The Wall Street Journal , about twice as many Florida Hispanics have voted early compared to 2012 . 
0	249	 However , African American turnout was down 11 percent this year , according to McClatchy DC .

1	257	 After deferring to China for Korea and seeing no results , President Trump 's return to disciplining China over trade crimes is the right position . 
1	257	 On Aug. 14 , President Trump authorized a probe on China 's trade practices , with a focus on intellectual property theft as well as theft of American technologies . 
1	257	 Add to the mix : devalued currency , refusal to sell fair quantities of American - made products , unbelievably low worker wages , lead and other poisons in dog food and baby food , plagiarized health and cancer research , deficient tires . 
1	257	 Trump has now come back around to the correct view . 
1	257	 The President slipped off the wagon for a while . 
1	257	 He pressed on the point that the U.S. needed China to help deter a nuclear North Korea . 
1	257	 However , dozens of missile tests later , with Kim Jong Un even closer to a long - range nuclear weapon , Trump now realizes that China only used the North Korea bait to give themselves more trade freedom against us . 
1	257	 It is time to call the Chinese government out . 
1	257	 The U.S. economy is weakened by Chinese intellectual property theft , counterfeit goods , and deficient products competing with American brands . 
1	257	 China was unwilling to help make North Korea release Otto Warmbier early enough to get him medical help . 
1	257	" In an interview on CNN Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) the Senate Democratic Leader , told Trump how to handle China : "" You say , ' you ca n't push America around anymore , ' which they 've been able to do for administration after administration . "
1	257	 Stop doing that . 
1	257	" The President should say , ' You 're not dealing with North Korea the way you should be . ' "" "
1	257	" On June 20 , Trump tweeted about Warmbier , "" While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea , it has not worked out . "
1	257	" At least I know China tried ! "" "
1	257	 Instead , China is giving us a victory here and there-- they will now import beef from us . 
1	257	 That 's nice of them . 
1	257	 Apparently we can sell cows to China , but not cars . 
1	257	 Schumer criticized Trump for at first reversing course . 
1	257	" In an April 12 press conference right after his meetings with China 's leader , Trump said , "" They 're not currency manipulators , "" which he had called them at least fifteen times on the campaign trail . "
1	257	" Schumer said of Trump and his team , "" Now they say they ( China ) are n't manipulating their currency . "
1	257	 They are . 
1	257	" I think China just does what it wants "" They gain trillions of dollars by stealing intellectual property , by dumping excess steel and aluminum . "
1	257	" The way to get China to help with North Korea is be tougher with them on trade . "" "
1	257	 How To Easily Kill All Indoor Odor , Mold , And Bacteria — Without Lifting A Finger Trump to End the Dollar as We Know It by August 1 , 2018 ? 
1	257	" President Trump said that when he met with President Xi at the White House , "" After listening for 10 minutes , I realized it 's not so easy . "
1	257	" I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power [ over ] North Korea . "" "
1	257	 Of course China has leverage over North Korea . 
1	257	 North Korea depends on China as a trading partner . 
1	257	" In 10 minutes , Trump 's view on China for thirty years apparently changed with a persuasive short argument from the president of a country that continually walks all over the U.S. This was Trump listening to the "" last man in the room "" at its worst . "
1	257	" Trump said he told President Xi , "" The way you 're going to make a good trade deal is to help us with North Korea ; otherwise we 're just going to go it alone . "" "
1	257	 The last part of that sentence is what the U.S. , along with its allies , should do . 
1	257	 China will help regardless because it 's in China 's own interest to do so . 
1	257	 Not allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. has been a Democratic issue for over forty years , from Dick Gephardt to Bernie Sanders , and it became a key one for Trump too-- a rare area of campaign agreement . 
1	257	 The president 's promise to stand up to China was one of the major reasons he won the election . 
1	257	 China should not get a free ride because we want their help with North Korea . 
1	257	 In 2015 , the FBI released a survey of 165 anonymous companies , half of which reported they had been victims of economic espionage . 
1	257	 Of that half , 95 percent blame China . 
1	257	 The counterfeit goods market in China costs companies $ 20 billion a year . 
1	257	" Are they buying us by Americans enjoying a $ 30 "" Rolex "" from a Times Square vendor ? "
1	257	 Simply put , China 's illegal actions are costing American jobs . 
1	257	" To prevent a nuclear North Korea , the recent U.S. deployment of the "" mother of all bombs "" was as much a warning to other countries , including North Korea , as it was about destroying ISIS tunnels in Afghanistan . "
1	257	 The U.S. has military might and is willing to use it . 
1	257	 North Korea knows that . 
1	257	 It is not worth caving to China , who costs the U.S. billions of dollars a year , and allowing them to keep manipulating currency and committing economic espionage . 
1	257	 Otto Warmbier 's coma and death , and Korea 's missile tests and H - bomb , are just more proof Schumer is right -- Instead of making nice with China , President Trump must hold them accountable , as he promised .

1	257	 On Aug. 14 , President Trump authorized a probe on China 's trade practices , with a focus on intellectual property theft as well as theft of American technologies . 
1	257	 Add to the mix : devalued currency , refusal to sell fair quantities of American - made products , unbelievably low worker wages , lead and other poisons in dog food and baby food , plagiarized health and cancer research , deficient tires . 
1	257	 Trump has now come back around to the correct view . 
1	257	 The President slipped off the wagon for a while . 
1	257	 He pressed on the point that the U.S. needed China to help deter a nuclear North Korea . 
1	257	 However , dozens of missile tests later , with Kim Jong Un even closer to a long - range nuclear weapon , Trump now realizes that China only used the North Korea bait to give themselves more trade freedom against us . 
1	257	 It is time to call the Chinese government out . 
1	257	 The U.S. economy is weakened by Chinese intellectual property theft , counterfeit goods , and deficient products competing with American brands . 
1	257	 China was unwilling to help make North Korea release Otto Warmbier early enough to get him medical help . 
1	257	" In an interview on CNN Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) the Senate Democratic Leader , told Trump how to handle China : "" You say , ' you ca n't push America around anymore , ' which they 've been able to do for administration after administration . "
1	257	 Stop doing that . 
1	257	" The President should say , ' You 're not dealing with North Korea the way you should be . ' "" "
1	257	" On June 20 , Trump tweeted about Warmbier , "" While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea , it has not worked out . "
1	257	" At least I know China tried ! "" "
1	257	 Instead , China is giving us a victory here and there-- they will now import beef from us . 
1	257	 That 's nice of them . 
1	257	 Apparently we can sell cows to China , but not cars . 
1	257	 Schumer criticized Trump for at first reversing course . 
1	257	" In an April 12 press conference right after his meetings with China 's leader , Trump said , "" They 're not currency manipulators , "" which he had called them at least fifteen times on the campaign trail . "
1	257	" Schumer said of Trump and his team , "" Now they say they ( China ) are n't manipulating their currency . "
1	257	 They are . 
1	257	" I think China just does what it wants "" They gain trillions of dollars by stealing intellectual property , by dumping excess steel and aluminum . "
1	257	" The way to get China to help with North Korea is be tougher with them on trade . "" "

1	262	As the GOP divides at the rate of human cells , and a self - destructive President Trump causes his own supporters to question how he can succeed , Democrats have refused to fill the leadership void with a better vision of governance . 
1	262	 Instead , they are partnering with the flailing Republicans and their president in failure . 
1	262	 Democrats are leaning indulgently on the politics of race and gratuitous opposition to Trump , and they appear content to be the party of sanctuary cities , safe spaces and single - payer health care . 
1	262	" Weeks ago they released an "" agenda "" designed to offer voters "" A Better Deal , "" but who would know what 's in it since all they talk about is Trump ? "
1	262	 Meanwhile , if Trump 's trajectory does n't improve , the party may face the weakest , most unpopular president in modern times in 2020 -- but with who ? 
1	262	 Sens . 
1	262	 Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are running , or think they are . 
1	262	 Why are they being encouraged ? 
1	262	" Sounding like a garden - variety conservative , liberal New York Times columnist Charles Blow asked last week on Twitter : "" Serious question : What is the Dem party now in addition to anti - Trump ? "
1	262	 What does it stand for now ? 
1	262	 Also , who 's leading ? # 
1	262	" GhostParty . "" "
1	262	 The last two weeks have been Trump 's worst in office , yet it seems the lower he sinks , Democratic leaders do likewise . 
1	262	 The president 's pathetic and irresponsible response to a white supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville -- where a protester was mowed down by a driver and killed -- has prompted not only fellow Republicans to criticize Trump but now his own National Economic Council director , Gary Cohn , as well . 
1	262	 Still , Democrats went overboard . 
1	262	" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is calling on Congress to censure the president for the "" repulsiveness of his words and actions , "" adding that "" every day , the president gives us further evidence of why such a censure is necessary . "" "
1	262	" Rep. Adam Schiff , the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , which is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any potential ties the president and his campaign had to those activities , responded Friday , saying in a Twitter post that he will co - sponsor a censure resolution because Trump "" expresses views inimical to our values . "" "
1	262	 Rep. Jackie Speier , another member of the committee , has called for Trump 's removal under the 25th Amendment . 
1	262	" Speier tweeted that "" POTUS is showing signs of erratic behavior and mental instability that place the country in grave danger . "" "
1	262	" Rep. Keith Ellison , deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee , said on CNN Monday that POTUS has "" sympathy "" for white supremacists . "
1	262	 He 's not just a congressman anymore but a party official -- no wonder the DNC 's fundraising is at a record low . 
1	262	" Rep. Maxine Waters , whose late - in - life internet fame recently landed her on "" The View , "" tweeted the day after Charlottesville that "" Trump has made it clear - w / Bannon & Gorka in the WH , & the Klan in the streets , it is now the White Supremacists House . # "
1	262	" Charlottesville . "" "
1	262	 Should Democrats win back the House next year , Waters would be chairman of the Financial Services Committee , an influential voice at the leadership table . 
1	262	" Former Vermont Gov. and DNC Chairman Howard "" The Scream "" Dean said last week , "" If you want to vote for a racist in the White House , then you better vote for Republicans . "" "
1	262	 The party elder recently declared he would stop contributing to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee because it will consider recruiting pro - life candidates . 
1	262	" After all these years , eight of them during President Obama 's two terms , Pelosi is now calling on the House Speaker Paul Ryan to remove Confederate statues -- which "" have always been reprehensible "" -- immediately from the halls of Congress "" if Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy . "" "
1	262	 Polling after the events in Charlottesville show that while a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump 's response , 62 percent said monuments to Confederate leaders should remain . 
1	262	 Yet these monuments are suddenly a pressing federal issue to national Democrats . 
1	262	" Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson , who enjoys great respect across aisle , has gone a step further than his party 's left , saying the statue removal is "" not a matter of political correctness , "" but "" of public safety and homeland security . "" "
1	262	 This from the man who never made the issue a priority as head of DHS . 
1	262	 While countering Trump is essential -- after all , Republicans are doing the same -- the focus should remain on even more fundamental matters : guarding the Constitution and the separation of powers ; stressing facts over falsehoods ; preventing a government shutdown that Trump 's lobbying for ; defending the right to a free press to hold him accountable ; urging him to pay cost - sharing reduction payments under the Affordable Care Act to provide more certainty to the fragile exchanges ; and pushing for any bipartisan cooperation possible on health care , tax reform and infrastructure projects . 
1	262	 Democrats must leave the fight to stop him and his family from running a kleptocracy , an issue the GOP remains silent on , to outsiders who have filed lawsuits . 
1	262	 Leave the statue debate to the states . 
1	262	 Leave the questions of his stability to Republicans like Sen. Bob Corker . 
1	262	 Leave the Russia investigation to special counsel Robert Mueller . 
1	262	 Let the media report on West Wing dysfunction or how much Trump television watches . 
1	262	 Democrats should leave all that alone . 
1	262	 Democrats must also decide whether they want President Obama back in the spotlight . 
1	262	 Rudderless and leaderless , some party operators long for him swoop in and right the ship , yet they still blame him for sinking it with epic election losses from 2009 to 2016 . 
1	262	 As they attempt to plot a path forward and regain seats in state legislatures , governorships , the U.S. House and Senate -- and someday the White House -- Democrats need new faces and leaders and ca n't lean too heavily on the 44th president . 
1	262	" Yet some are calling for him to be a loud voice : "" None of the potential Democratic presidential candidates have the visibility or credibility to be effective , "" party strategist Brad Bannon told The Hill . "
1	262	 Finally , as Democrats like Reps . 
1	262	" Brad Sherman , Al Green and Gwen Moore continue to push for impeachment , party leaders must avoid what Obama 's onetime senior adviser David Axelrod warned would likely be a costly mistake . "" "
1	262	" Remember : A third of the country supports this president , "" he said on CNN . "" "
1	262	 That 's a very dangerous road to go down . 
1	262	" And if you ever did go down that road , you 're opening a Pandora 's box that will never end . "" "
1	262	 What 's already in that box is widespread voter disgust . 
1	262	 People are turning away from both parties and the pool of gettable voters is shrinking , which means base politics will be less and less effective in the years to come . 
1	262	 Democrats must convince voters they take governing more seriously than partisan politics and will focus on economic growth instead of statues , tweets and Russia . 
1	262	 Or they can stay in the minority a lot longer .

0	263	BERKELEY , Calif. ( KCRA ) — 
0	263	 Several fights broke out during largely - peaceful protests in Berkeley Sunday afternoon when about 4,000 people converged on the city , police said . 
0	263	" Thirteen people who ranged in ages from 20 to 47 years old , were arrested for "" various violations "" including assault with a deadly weapon and felony assault during the events , Berkeley police said . "
0	263	 Of the people arrested during the protests , several were wearing masks while others were connected to assaults . 
0	263	 Two men were arrested after exchanging blows . 
0	263	 The SFGate reported they were quickly swept up by officers inside Civic Center Park . 
0	263	 Police detained Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson at the protests . 
0	263	 The SFGate reported he was handcuffed after being chased by a mob of demonstrators who took swings at him and pepper sprayed him . 
0	263	" Police said Gibson was actually "" rescued "" and was not arrested or charged . "
0	263	 The crowd began to diminish around 3:30 p.m. , six hours after a march led to the protests . 
0	263	 The event was one of several rallies that had been called for Sunday in Berkeley , a day after a controversial freedom rally planned by Gibson in San Francisco fizzled amid throngs of counterprotesters . 
0	263	 Hundreds of people gathered on the UC Berkeley campus around 10 a.m. Sunday . 
0	263	 They then marched to Civic Center Park , where police had set up barricades and secured the area with bomb sniffing dogs . 
0	263	 The march was part of the Bay Area Rally Against Hate Rally . 
0	263	" In a statement early Sunday , the group said "" we fully intend to move forward with ( the Rally Against Hate ) "" on the campus despite calls by the university police department for people to stay away for safety reasons . "
0	263	" The rally was held in response to the planned right - wing protest "" No To Marxism in America . "" "
0	263	 However , organizer Amber Cummings canceled the protest on Friday , saying Berkeley officials and left - wing extremists made it impossible to hold the event and she would be the sole attendee . 
0	263	 Despite the cancellation , hundreds of ring - wing protesters showed up to the park . 
0	263	 Around 1 p.m. , police reported the crowd had grown to several thousand . 
0	263	 A skirmish broke out between several dozen left - wing demonstrators and a handful of right - wing supporters . 
0	263	 The skirmish was tense but ended quickly . 
0	263	 The left - wing protesters surrounded the small number of right - wing supporters , then shouted at them and pushed them . 
0	263	 The right - wing protesters sought protection from police and were escorted away . 
0	263	" Before the unpermitted events , Berkeley police put into place several rules in response the protests , stating , "" To ensure the peaceful expression of free speech , the City of Berkeley will be prohibiting sticks , pipes , poles and anything else that can be used for a ' riot ' at Civic Center Park . "" "
0	263	 Other banned items include explosives , pepper spray , axes , dogs ( except for service animals ) , eggs , torches and more . 
0	263	" Police also said anything that "" covers or partially covers the face and shields the wearer 's face from view , or partially from view , is prohibited . "" "
0	263	 However , protesters with an anarchist group arrived at the park wearing masks and hoods that covered their faces . 
0	263	" The group of more than 100 hooded protesters , with shields emblazoned with the words "" no hate "" and waving a flag identifying themselves as anarchist , broke through police lines , avoiding security checks by officers to take away possible weapons . "
0	263	 Then the group blended in with the rest of the crowd . 
0	263	 The group pushed their way past police barricades and into Civic Center Park . 
0	263	 They assaulted at least five people by punching and kicking them . 
0	263	 Gibson was one of the people assaulted by the group . 
0	263	 Police broke up the fights , using what appeared to be a smoke grenade to stop one scuffle . 
0	263	 The three people who were attacked ran behind police lines to escape . 
0	263	 Then around 2:30 p.m. , more than 1,000 people left the park and began marching north Martin Luther King Way . 
0	263	 An hour later , the crowd had diminished and many roads reopened .

1	265	Opinion 
1	265	 Modal Trigger 
1	265	 Hillary Clinton 
1	265	 As the presidential campaigns sink to the challenge of demonstrating that there is no such thing as rock bottom , remember this : When the Clintons decamped from Washington in January 2001 , they took some White House furnishings that were public property . 
1	265	 They also finished accepting more than $ 190,000 in gifts , including two coffee tables and two chairs , a $ 7,375 gratuity from Denise Rich , whose fugitive former husband had been pardoned in President Clinton 's final hours . 
1	265	" A Washington Post editorial ( "" Count the Spoons "" ) identified "" the Clintons ' defining characteristic : They have no capacity for embarrassment . "
1	265	 Words like shabby and tawdry come to mind . 
1	265	" They do n't begin to do it justice . "" "
1	265	 Today , Hillary Clinton strives to live again among some White House furnishings that she and her helpmeet were compelled to disgorge , her campaign flounders because as secretary of state some of the nation 's business might have been melded with the contents of a computer that is pertinent to an FBI investigation of a former Democratic congressman 's alleged sexual texting with a female minor . 
1	265	 Ransack the English language for words to do this justice . 
1	265	" During the recent welter of reports about the Clintons ' self - dealing through their charity that has been very charitable to them , The New Yorker , reporting her plans to uplift the downtrodden , quoted her aspiration : "" I want to really marry the public and the private sector . "" "
1	265	 This would solve the Clintons ' problem of discerning the line between public business and private aggrandizement : Erase the line . 
1	265	 So , herewith America 's choice . 
1	265	 Restore the House of Clinton . 
1	265	 Or confer executive powers — powers that President Obama by his audacity , and Congress by its lethargy , have proven to be essentially unlimited — on another competitor in the sleaze sweepstakes , Donald Trump , who shares his opponent 's disinclination to disentangle the personal and the political . 
1	265	" Into this political maelstrom , FBI Director James Comey injected an announcement that intensified the chaos without providing a scintilla of news that voters can use : An unknown number of emails of unknown provenance and unknown content might be "" pertinent "" to an investigation that already has established , beyond peradventure , that Secretary Clinton was "" extremely careless "" with sensitive material . "
1	265	 Add the FBI , and the Justice Department to which it belongs , to the carnage of institutions that is a byproduct of bad judgments by the political class that have voters asking Casey Stengel 's question . 
1	265	" In 1962 , Stengel , manager of the New York Mets , an expansion team en route to a record of 120 losses , looked down his dugout at his woebegone players and wondered aloud , "" Ca n't anybody here play this game ? "" "
1	265	 It is grimly hilarious to hear it said that the Justice Department , by not holding Comey to established protocols concerning discussions of ongoing investigations , and concerning pronouncements close to elections , has tainted itself . 
1	265	 ObamaCare would not have passed if Justice Department lawyers had not conducted what a federal judge declared a corrupt prosecution of Alaska 's Republican senator Ted Stevens , costing him re - election . 
1	265	 The department has enabled , by not seriously investigating , the IRS ' suppression of political advocacy by conservative groups . 
1	265	 Or of the IRS ' subsequent destruction of subpoenaed emails pertinent to this . 
1	265	 So , unsurprisingly , the most intrusive and potentially punitive federal agency continues to punish conservative groups for being conservative , according to Cleta Mitchell , a lawyer for political groups who confirms there are indeed conservative organizations that were targeted by the IRS and have still not received their tax - exempt status . 
1	265	" In 2013 , Barack Obama professed himself "" angry "" about "" inexcusable "" IRS behavior , before he decided there was not a "" smidgen "" of IRS corruption . "
1	265	 He claimed to have learned about the IRS behavior from the media . 
1	265	 Now he claims that he learned from the media about Clinton 's email abuses , although they had exchanged emails using her private server . 
1	265	 Perhaps . 
1	265	 The defining scandal of the Obama era has been the media 's lackadaisical consensus that Obama 's administration has had no serious scandal . 
1	265	" This , although with the Justice Department protecting the IRS , the administration has ( in the words of Richard Nixon 's White House counsel John Dean ) used "" the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies . "" "
1	265	 Clinton , the ultimate author of her current agony , resembles no one so much as Nixon in her paranoia and joyless pursuit of joy . 
1	265	 Her government career began with the House committee preparing Nixon 's impeachment . 
1	265	" Twenty - two years earlier , he had saved his career by addressing a supposed scandal with his nationally broadcast "" Checkers speech , "" which was mawkish , abasing and effective . "
1	265	" How fitting it would be for a Clinton "" Checkers speech "" to end our long national nightmare that this campaign has been .A Nixonian end to the 2016 sleaze sweepstakes ?"

1	267	 Barack Obama increased the US national debt by nearly $ 10 trillion dollars and the liberal media SAID NOTHING ! 
1	267	 But now that President Trump is in office the liberal media had suddenly developed a new found interest in government spending . 
1	267	 On Sunday Vice President Mike Pence attended the Indianapolis Colts game against the San Francisco 49ers . 
1	267	 The VP had planned to attend the game for weeks . 
1	267	 But after the NFL millionaires disrespected the US flag and military by kneeling during the national anthem , Vice President Pence and his wife walked out of the game . 
1	267	 The liberal media is attacking the vice president for defending the flag and military . 
1	267	 Several liberal hacks lashed out at the vice president after he left the game . 
1	267	 Now this … CNN actually tabulated the cost of Mike Pence 's trip to the game . 
1	267	 As if they give a damn about government spending ! 
1	267	 This is CNN : 
1	267	 How much did Vice President Mike Pence 's trip to Indianapolis to watch — and then abruptly leave — a football game Sunday between the Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers cost ? 
1	267	 Here is an estimate of just the air costs ( which does not include costs of advance personnel , Secret Service or support on the ground ) : 
1	267	 According to the Air Force , flying a C-32 , the model of plane used for Air Force 2 , for one hour costs about $ 30,000 . 
1	267	 Pence 's flight from Las Vegas to Indianapolis Saturday took about three hours and 20 minutes , so it cost about $ 100,000 
1	267	 Pence then flew from Indianapolis to Los Angeles on Sunday , which took about four hours and 45 minutes , costing about $ 142,500 . 
1	267	 The grand total : about $ 242,500 .

1	272	 James Comey 
1	272	 As soon as FBI Director James Comey announced the revival of the investigation into Hillary Clinton 's private e - mail server , Democrats went on the attack — against Comey . 
1	272	 The lowest is the party 's top smear - meister : Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid . 
1	272	" The same Harry Reid who flat - out lied in 2012 in claiming a "" confidential source "" told him Mitt Romney had paid no income taxes for a decade . ( "
1	272	 In fact , Romney paid millions . ) 
1	272	" The same Harry Reid who still calls that lie "" one of the best things I 've ever done "" — simply because "" Romney did n't win . "" "
1	272	" Now he 's wildly accusing Comey of suppressing evidence about Donald Trump 's "" close ties and coordination "" with Vladimir Putin 's government . "
1	272	 And he 's not alone : Democrats and their media allies have unleashed an unbridled attack on Comey , accusing him of violating federal law with his Friday letter to Congress . 
1	272	 He 's endangering democracy , they say , and deliberately sabotaging Clinton . 
1	272	 What a load of hypocritical hooey . 
1	272	 In June , Democrats praised Comey to the skies after he gave Hillary a free pass on her private server . 
1	272	 Never mind that , as former Attorney General Michael Mukasey argued , her actions appear to have violated several statutes , and others have been prosecuted for far less . 
1	272	" Now that Comey wants to check the e - mails from Anthony Weiner 's devices , he 's become an agent of the "" vast right - wing conspiracy "" that Clinton says has been hounding her for 25 years . "
1	272	 Sorry : After clearing Clinton four months ago , Comey had no choice but to announce the discovery of potential fresh evidence in the case — evidence that should 've been handed over long ago . 
1	272	 If he 'd tried to keep a lid on it , the political impact would be far bigger when the news inevitably leaked . 
1	272	 We 're glad to see the White House playing it cool , announcing that President Obama does n't believe Comey is trying to influence the election outcome . 
1	272	 The fault here is not with the FBI but with the Democrats ' own candidate , Hillary Clinton , who plainly believes the law does n't matter if it conflicts with her desire for secrecy . 
1	272	 Just as Harry Reid believes the truth does n't matter — as long as the Democrats win .Do n't buy Harry Reid 's smear of FBI boss James Comey

0	274	 Michael Peake / Toronto Sun / Postmedia Network 
0	274	 Michael Douglas has jumped ahead of allegations he masturbated in front of a former employee , insisting he 's not about to sit back and become the villain of a harassment story . 
0	274	 The Basic Instinct star claims staff at both The Hollywood Reporter and Variety have reached out for feedback concerning accusations he pleasured himself in front of an employee three decades ago , and he 's keen to get ahead of the story , before he joins the likes of Harvey Weinstein , Louis C.K. , Jeremy Piven , and Brett Ratner , among others , who have been accused of sexual misconduct . 
0	274	" Douglas has turned to movie news website Deadline to set the story straight , stating , "" I felt the need to get ahead of this . "" "
0	274	" Revealing that The Hollywood Reporter contacted him via his attorney regarding the woman 's claims that he used "" colourful language "" in front of her , "" spoke raunchily , or dirtily with friends of mine in private conversations on the phone "" . "
0	274	" The woman 's third claim was that the actor masturbated in front of her , to which Douglas responds , "" I remembered this woman : sophisticated intelligent , good sense of humour , a novelist , who has written books and published novels and was an active feminist , and proud of it . "
0	274	 My head was reeling . 
0	274	" I just could n't put this together . "" "
0	274	" Insisting she "" could have excused herself "" if she was offended by the language he used in private conversations , Douglas adds the allegations he blackballed the unnamed women are "" completely untrue "" . "
0	274	" He adds that the claims he masturbated in front of her are "" a complete lie , fabrication "" . "
0	274	" According to the actor , the journalist at The Hollywood Reporter agreed to sit on the story over the holidays , but in the New Year the publication got back in touch and said , "" ‘ She 's ( accuser ) running around , possibly trying to give this story to other people , so we 're going to run with it ' . "
0	274	" "" I said , ‘ I do n't think that 's justification , just because you might get scooped , to run a story like this ' … I was floored , "" he continues . "" "
0	274	 I did n't know what to say and I tried to digest it . 
0	274	 The accusations are minimal , except of course for the idea of masturbating in front of her . 
0	274	 She supposedly had three friends who would back her up , that she had mentioned this to … 
0	274	" "" How am I , in a 50 year career in this industry , dealing with an employee 33 years ago who perhaps is disgruntled that I let her go , even though I have never heard from her in 32 years . "
0	274	 And a legitimate trade publication is going to try and print this story ? 
0	274	" There is no corroboration , just that they found out somebody else might run the story . "" "
0	274	" Douglas calls the whole saga "" extremely painful "" , adding , "" I pride myself on my reputation in this business … I 'm bewildered why , after 32 years , this is coming out , now . "
0	274	" "" The part that hurt the worst is having to share something like this to your wife and your children . "

0	274	 I have jobs going with studios who all seem to be supportive at this time .

1	276	 According to NPR , many of the 50,000 street - vending operations in L.A. are currently run by immigrants , some of whom may be in the country illegally . 
1	276	 So , in order to prevent U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials from having another reason to detain , arrest or deport vendors , the Los Angeles City Council is moving to legalize vendor operations across the city .

1	276	 By Stephen Owsinski ; OpsLens : 
1	276	 Ever wake up and go on about your day as you please , without complying with laws or having to pay your fair share of taxes ? 
1	276	 Although a tax - free life is enticing , I firmly adhere to my patriotic duty as an American citizen investing in the United States by paying taxes . 
1	276	" However , "" sovereign citizens "" do not feel that way and opt to make up their own rules which , basically , refrain from playing by the rules whatsoever . "
1	276	 A man in Washington County , Oregon did just that . 
1	276	 He ignored our laws and thought he 'd be Scot - free of responsibility … until a deputy sheriff got behind his pickup truck and saw his license plate . 
1	276	" It read "" No driver license or insurance required . "" "
1	276	 You know how license plates have unique characters identifying the vehicle / owner , like ABC-123 ? 
1	276	" Well this sovereign citizen 's vehicle license was to the point , displaying the special characters "" PRIVATE "" below which were the words "" Not for Commerce Use - Private Mode of Travel . "" "
1	276	" Craftily , the license plate also had a logo depicting our shared planet , encircled by the words "" Peace on Earth … Good Will Towards Men . "" "
1	276	 No color scheme was used , only a black - on - white graphic design . 
1	276	 Frankly , because it was so well designed , I am led to believe it was mass - produced for other sovereign citizens to tool around in their cars or trucks , doing as they please . 
1	276	 Entitlements come in all shapes and forms ; just ask any cop about the bizarre culture they encounter on the streets . 
1	276	 For his role , Richard Leroy Garrison , 63 , was arrested and charged with failure to carry and present a valid license and interfering with a peace officer . 
1	276	 His vehicle bearing a fake license plate was impounded by Washington County cops . 
1	276	 Why impounded ? 
1	276	 Since Garrison 's vehicle was involved in the commission of a crime , law enforcement authorities reserve the right to tow said mode of transportation . 
1	276	 Besides , every state 's motor vehicle laws require that only properly registered cars be permitted to drive upon its public thoroughfares . 
1	276	 Invalid license plates equates to an immobilized car , so towing is the remedy . 
1	276	 It is customary protocol throughout the United States as it pertains to motor vehicle statutes and compliance with same . 
1	276	 Like pay - to - play , only legitimate . 
1	276	 Motor vehicle registration fees , surcharges and taxes fund the actual public roads motorists drive upon . 
1	276	 So , a so - called sovereign citizen like Mr. Garrison is traversing roadways we paid for , exempting himself from highway maintenance . 
1	276	 In his mind , it 's that simple . 
1	276	 This is not the first time a self - professed sovereign citizen motoring down a tax - payer funder public roadway was stopped by police and arrested for his / her vehicle 's attached license plate . 
1	276	 I 'm not referring to a state - issued , legally sanctioned license plate with a minor expiration date violation . 
1	276	 In most cases , that is a civil infraction resulting in nothing more than a ticket or warning to get it updated . 
1	276	 I am referring to an artificial DIY license plate clandestinely manufactured by anti - government groups whose membership believes it does not have to comply with our nation 's laws . 
1	276	 These folks are not only anti - police — although it is law enforcement officers who get to engage their subversive tendencies — they are opposed to all - things - government . 
1	276	 Self - proclaimed sovereign citizens go about their lives fully relinquishing the responsibility of social norms practiced and funded by law - abiding citizens . 
1	276	 Adhering to all federal , state and local laws is not their cup of tea . 
1	276	" Therefore , the Tea Party -whose "" mission is to bring awareness to any issue which challenges the security , sovereignty , or domestic tranquility of our beloved nation , the United States of America""- is definitely not in the cards for this bunch . "
1	276	 So what exactly is a sovereign citizen and what are the philosophies , objectives , and membership all about ? 
1	276	 According to the FBI , sovereign citizens can be violent extremists . 
1	276	" The FBI defines "" sovereign citizens "" as "" domestic terrorism "" made of members who are deemed "" anti - government extremists who believe that even though they physically reside in this country , they are separate or ‘ sovereign ' from the United States . "
1	276	" As a result , they believe they do n't have to answer to any government authority , including courts , taxing entities , motor vehicle departments , or law enforcement . "" "
1	276	 The perils are palpable . 
1	276	 Our nation has experienced instances whereby some proclaiming sovereign citizenship had no pause before going up against and horrifically murdering police officials , exacting full - on gun battles . 
1	276	" The FBI reports that sovereign citizens are a "" growing domestic threat to law enforcement , "" capable of violence and government subversion . "
1	276	 At its core , sovereign citizenship holds jurisdictional indifference and believes the US operates without care or concern for its citizens . 
1	276	 Hence , they go it alone , albeit illegally . 
1	276	 Sovereign citizens can poke holes in our national security defenses as well as our country 's stability . 
1	276	 Be not fooled by statistics and verbiage claiming sovereign citizens are a loosely - knit group informally conducting their lives without any recognized leadership . 
1	276	" In fact , federal intelligence agencies do not bill them as neither an anarchist group nor a militia , "" although they sometimes buy and use illegal weapons . "" "
1	276	 However informal they may be as a demographic , their belief system fuels the dangers they present . 
1	276	 Spontaneous outbursts when stopped by police have culminated in volleys of bullets . 
1	276	 Police training now includes how to deal with sovereign citizens , and law enforcement trainers indoctrinate street cops in optimal ways to handle these particular encounters . 
1	276	 FBI reports indicate these folks are engaged in and finance themselves with white collar crimes such as mortgage fraud , counterfeit currency and money orders , credit fraud , identity theft , and false tax filings . 
1	276	" Just as it is often said "" Driving is a privilege , not a right "" accorded by law , the allowance is never free . "
1	276	" And that is the pulse of "" sovereign citizen "" philosophy , that they do as they please without abiding by government … to include ( exclude ) paying a fair share otherwise known as taxes . "
1	276	" Given Mr. Garrison 's age , I presume he listened to Frank Sinatra croon "" I Did It My Way . "" "
1	276	" He may also have had the experience of listening to lyrics such as "" I Fought the Law and the Law Won . "" "
1	276	 I bet getting his vehicle out of police impound will be an interesting feat for Mr. Garrison and others embracing the sovereign citizen belief system . 
1	276	 Must be legal to roll on down the road , no ifs , ands or buts .

1	277	Jemele Hill in September 2016 . 
1	277	" Jemele Hill , the outspoken host of ESPN 's 6:00 p.m. SportsCenter , called President Donald Trump a "" white supremacist "" on Twitter . "
1	277	" ESPN later posted a statement , saying her comments "" do not represent the position of ESPN "" and she knows her comment was "" inappropriate . "" "
1	277	" The White House called Hill 's comments a "" fireable offense . "" "
1	277	 The 41-year - old Hill has been hosting the 6:00 edition of SportsCenter , dubbed SC6 with Michael Smith since February . 
1	277	 Hill and Smith previously co - hosted Numbers Never Lie and His & Hers before they were promoted to the flagship show . 
1	277	 You can follow Hill on Twitter . 
1	277	 Here 's what you need to know about Hill 's politics and her latest brush with controversy . 
1	277	 1 . 
1	277	 Hill Called Trump a ‘ White Supremacist ' After Posting About Kid Rock 
1	277	 Hill 's tweet about Trump was posted late on September 11 after she retweeted a The Hill article about musician Kid Rock , who has been teasing a run for Michigan Senator after launching KidRockforSenate.com in July . 
1	277	" The article is about Rock 's long Facebook post about the "" extreme left . "" "" "" "
1	277	" Pretty funny how scared I have them all and their only agenda is to try and label people / me racist who do not agree or cower to them , "" Rock wrote . "
1	277	" "" He loves black people so much that he pandered to racists by using a flag that unquestionably stands for dehumanizing black people , "" Hill wrote , referring to the singer 's use of the Confederate Battle flag . "
1	277	" After a back - and - forth with other Twitter users , Hill wrote , "" Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists . "" "
1	277	" Hill also tweeted other messages about Trump . "" "
1	277	 He is unqualified and unfit to be president . 
1	277	 He is not a leader . 
1	277	 And if he were not white , he never would have been elected . 
1	277	" He has surrounded himself with white supremacists — no they are not "" alt right "" — and you want me to believe he is n't a white supremacist ? "" "
1	277	" She went on , "" Trump is the most ignorant , offensive president of my lifetime . "
1	277	 His rise is a direct result of white supremacy . 
1	277	 Period . 
1	277	 The height of white privilege is being able to ignore his white supremacy , because it 's of no threat to you . 
1	277	" Well , it 's a threat to me . "" "
1	277	" "" Donald Trump is a bigot . "
1	277	 Glad you could live with voting for him . 
1	277	" I could n't , because I cared about more than just myself , "" she wrote . "
1	277	 After the tweet gained attention in the conservative media , ESPN issued a statement . 
1	277	" "" The comments on Twitter from Jemele Hill regarding the President do not represent the position of ESPN , "" the statement reads . "" "
1	277	" We have addressed this with Jemele and she recognizes her actions were inappropriate . "" "
1	277	 Hill has continued to Tweet , but on other subjects . 
1	277	 2 . 
1	277	 Hill Has Tweeted About Politics Before , Despite ESPN 's 2016 Memo Asking Talent Not to Tweet About Politics 
1	277	 Hill has made her politics clear on her Twitter page . 
1	277	 She has a tweet with photos of her 2015 and 2016 visits to the White House to meet President Barack Obama pinned to her page . 
1	277	 Twitter users frequently complain to her , and she typically responds . 
1	277	 In January 2016 , ESPN issued a memo to employees to avoid making political comments . 
1	277	" Since then , Sage Steele lost a hosting position after writing that she was sad to see the "" joy "" in the faces of anti - Trump protesters . "
1	277	 Curt Schilling was famously fired in April 2016 for an offensive post about transgender people . 
1	277	" After the Pulse nightclub shootings in Orlando in June 2016 , when a man killed 49 people inside a gay nightclub , Hill wrote , "" So in a country where we have done everything possible to undermine the LGBTQ community , we are suddenly lecturing Islam on homophobia . "
1	277	" Oh . "" "
1	277	 Forbes asked ESPN PR why Hill was n't fired after that message . 
1	277	 A spokesperson told the magazine that Hill 's statement was n't a violation of the 2016 memo . 
1	277	 3 . 
1	277	 Hill Defended Politics Appearing on ESPN , Saying ‘ Athletes Are Dragging Us Here ' 
1	277	 ESPN has been dealing with subscriber losses for some time , and its apparent liberal slant on politics has taken the blame in the media . 
1	277	 Conservatives point to Schilling 's firing and Caitlyn Jenner receiving the Arthur Ashe courage award in 2015 as examples . 
1	277	 Not firing Hill for her comments will certainly not help . 
1	277	 SportCenter‘s Linda Cohn also admitted that politics are hurting ESPN . 
1	277	 During a conference in June , Hill defended the coverage of political topics , noting that the athletes they cover have made it difficult to avoid politics . 
1	277	" "" I just had n't noticed the correlation between us being called more liberal as you see more women in a position on our network … as you see more ethnic diversity , then all of a sudden ESPN is too liberal . "
1	277	" So I wonder , when people say that , what they 're really saying , "" Hill said , reports Yahoo News . "" "
1	277	" The other part of it is that we 're journalists , and people have to understand , these uncomfortable political conversations … the athletes are dragging us here . "" "
1	277	 Hill continued , noting that they never asked Colin Kaepernick to kneel during the national anthem and they did n't expect Gregg Popovich to go off on Donald Trump during press conferences . 
1	277	" "" You have athletes saying they 're going to the White House , not going to the White House , that 's all sports news , "" Hill continued . "" "
1	277	 It did n't just start with this generation of athletes , it 's always been that way . 
1	277	 Sometimes when I hear a viewer say they do n't want their politics mixed with sports , I say , ‘ What did you think about Muhammad Ali ? ' 
1	277	" And then all of a sudden it 's glowing praise . "" "
1	277	 Hill made similar comments in an interview with Newsday . 
1	277	" "" Whether we want to discuss it or not , athletes are dragging us into these conversations , "" Hill said in January . "" "
1	277	 It 's not that Mike and I wake up one day and say , ‘ Hey , today we 're going to be MSNBC . ' 
1	277	" It 's usually based off a news story that is relevant to sports . "" "
1	277	 4 . 
1	277	 Hill Joined ESPN in 2006 As a Columnist & Mentioned Race in Her Columns 
1	277	 Hill has been at ESPN since 2006 , when she joined EPSN.com as a columnist . 
1	277	 Over time , she began appearing on ESPN TV shows , including First Take , Outside the Lines and others . 
1	277	 A short time after she was hired , she spoke with the Columbia Journalism Review about being a young , black female journalist and the reaction you get when you write about race . 
1	277	" "" Any time you write about race , people get incensed , "" Hill said in 2006 . "" "
1	277	 I recently wrote a column saying that there is just as much evidence against Lance Armstrong as there is [ against ] Barry Bonds , and part of the reason there is this extraordinary benefit of the doubt extended to Lance is because he 's white . 
1	277	 That 's not the overwhelming reason , mind you . 
1	277	 Just a factor in the whole equation . 
1	277	" I got a ton of mail about that one , even though I posed the racial element in the next - to - last graf of the column . "" "
1	277	 In 2011 , she started the His & Hers podcast with Michael Smith , which soon replaced Smith 's Numbers Never Lie in 2013 . 
1	277	 They continued hosting the show until they moved to SportsCenter . 
1	277	 Their part of the show is known as SC6 With Michael And Jemele . 
1	277	 The Los Angeles Times reported in March that Smith and Hill signed new contracts , even as ESPN had its massive lay - off earlier this year . 
1	277	 Hill told Dan Patrick that their contracts were n't up for another year when they were approached to host SC6 . 
1	277	" "" The fact that they asked us to do this , that 's a key part of it . "
1	277	 This was not our plan . 
1	277	" We were about a year out from our contract being up , "" Hill said in January . "" "
1	277	 We knew that they liked us and wanted us to keep doing our thing . 
1	277	 We were of the mentality that we were just going to be His and Hers . 
1	277	 And what were things that were needed to improve that ? 
1	277	" And the way it just kind of happened caught us by surprise . "" "
1	277	 5 . 
1	277	 Hill Was Suspended in 2008 for Writing That Rooting for the Celtics Would Be Like ‘ Saying Hitler Was a Victim ' 
1	277	 In 2008 , Hill had her first brush with controversy at ESPN . 
1	277	" The Detroit native compared rooting for the Boston Celtics instead of the Pistons to "" saying Hitler was a victim . "" "
1	277	" "" Rooting for the Celtics is like saying Hitler was a victim . "
1	277	 It 's like hoping Gorbachev would get to the blinking red button before Reagan . 
1	277	" Deserving or not , I still hate the Celtics , "" Hill wrote . "
1	277	 Hill was suspended for a week and the statement was taken out of her column . 
1	277	 She also wrote an apology . 
1	277	 However , this was actually just the start of another controversy , as ESPN 's Lou Holtz made a similar remark later that year . 
1	277	 He apologized too , but was n't suspended . 
1	277	 In an interview with Deadspin , Hill shrugged it off . 
1	277	" "" Many have said that ESPN treated me unfairly . "
1	277	 The 64,000 question : How do I really feel ? 
1	277	" My initial answer is a story , or rather , a moment , "" she told Deadspin in 2008 . "" "
1	277	 A couple years ago , I was visiting the Poynter Institute , one of the foremost journalism think tanks in the country , and I sat in on a session taught by one of my favorite columnist and people , the Washington Post 's Sally Jenkins . 
1	277	 A student asked her if she ever got upset when other writers rewarded — particularly if she knew they were n't as good . 
1	277	 And Sally said — and I 'm paraphrasing here — that she always prided herself on keeping her eyes on her own career . 
1	277	 That 's my answer . 
1	277	" That 's how I feel . ""Jemele Hill 's Politics : 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know"

1	279	 At moments of crisis in our nation , in addition to invoking the assistance of Higher powers , we can call upon the Constitution for guidance . 
1	279	" Article I , Section 8 , of the U.S. Constitution contains a long - forgotten provision , "" the coinage clause , "" which empowered Congress "" to coin ( create ) Money . "" "
1	279	 The ability to create money to meet the needs of the nation is a sovereign power , which enables a nation to have control of its own destiny . 
1	279	 The same article indicates the Founders anticipated having to borrow money on the full faith and credit of the United States . 
1	279	 Enter the Funding Act of 1790 , which assumed and paid off the debt of the colonies and retired the financial obligations of the newly created states now united . 
1	279	 This was a powerful , object lesson in debt retirement , relevant today . 
1	279	 It is abundantly clear from a plain reading of the coinage clause that the Founders never intended that the only way the government was to be funded was to borrow money . 
1	279	 The needs of the nation were to come from a system of not borrowing wherein money was a neutral value of exchange connecting resources , people and needs , without debt attached . 
1	279	 In 1913 , the passage of the Federal Reserve Act ceded the constitutional power to create money ( and control of our national destiny ) , to the Federal Reserve , a quasi - private central bank . 
1	279	 At this fateful point , the only way money could be brought into being was to borrow it , whereby money became equated with debt . 
1	279	 The money system transited from public control to private control , and there it has remained . 
1	279	 Instead of following the path set forth by the Founders to create money directly , our government became obliged to borrow from private banks , which assumed the sovereign power to create money from nothing and then loan it to the government , turning on its head the intention of the Founders . 
1	279	 As a member of Congress , I came to the conclusion that while the debate over taxation was interesting , it was wholly insufficient . 
1	279	 One must first study how money is created , before one can sensibly have a discussion of how it is to be taxed . 
1	279	 With the help of staff , I spent a full five years working with legislative counsel to come up with a way to realign with the founding principles , to reclaim and to re - establish for our nation the sovereign power to create money . 
1	279	 The vehicle was H.R. 2990 , the National Emergency Employment Defense ( NEED Act ) , which articulates why the current debate over the debt ceiling should lead directly to a debate about monetary policy , and the origins of the debt - based economic system . 
1	279	 How To Easily Kill All Indoor Odor , Mold , And Bacteria — Without Lifting A Finger No More Tinnitus ( Ear Ringing ) If You Do This Immediately 
1	279	 In our work on the NEED Act , we propound that the present monetary system has led to a concentration of wealth , expansion of national debt , excessive reliance on taxation , devaluation of the currency , increases in the cost of public infrastructure , unemployment and underemployment and the erosion of the ability of Congress to meet the needs of the American people . 
1	279	 This system has been a source of financial instability where the banks ' ability to create money out of nothing has become a financial liability for the American taxpayers . 
1	279	 When banks engaged in speculative lending , turning the financial system into a casino , they were bailed out while millions of Americans lost their homes . 
1	279	 No surprise that today we are told there is not enough money for creating jobs , rebuilding America , health care , education and retirement security . 
1	279	 But there is always money to bail out the banks . 
1	279	 Let us take the opportunity afforded in the debate over the debt ceiling to regain control of our sovereignty and our national destiny . 
1	279	 We can have a future of abundance instead of poverty , but we must first take down the wall which separates us from our true sovereignty , the power to coin and create money . 
1	279	 Let us return to first principles , and reclaim the constitutional power to coin and create United States money and spend it into circulation to meet the needs of the nation and reduce taxes . 
1	279	 Two hundred and thirty years ago this month , delegates from 13 states gathered in a constitutional convention , which set the stage for ratification . 
1	279	 Let us summon that same revolutionary spirit and its wisdom to guide us in the days ahead .

1	279	 Enter the Funding Act of 1790 , which assumed and paid off the debt of the colonies and retired the financial obligations of the newly created states now united . 
1	279	 This was a powerful , object lesson in debt retirement , relevant today . 
1	279	 It is abundantly clear from a plain reading of the coinage clause that the Founders never intended that the only way the government was to be funded was to borrow money . 
1	279	 The needs of the nation were to come from a system of not borrowing wherein money was a neutral value of exchange connecting resources , people and needs , without debt attached . 
1	279	 In 1913 , the passage of the Federal Reserve Act ceded the constitutional power to create money ( and control of our national destiny ) , to the Federal Reserve , a quasi - private central bank . 
1	279	 At this fateful point , the only way money could be brought into being was to borrow it , whereby money became equated with debt . 
1	279	 The money system transited from public control to private control , and there it has remained . 
1	279	 Instead of following the path set forth by the Founders to create money directly , our government became obliged to borrow from private banks , which assumed the sovereign power to create money from nothing and then loan it to the government , turning on its head the intention of the Founders . 
1	279	 As a member of Congress , I came to the conclusion that while the debate over taxation was interesting , it was wholly insufficient . 
1	279	 One must first study how money is created , before one can sensibly have a discussion of how it is to be taxed . 
1	279	 With the help of staff , I spent a full five years working with legislative counsel to come up with a way to realign with the founding principles , to reclaim and to re - establish for our nation the sovereign power to create money . 
1	279	 The vehicle was H.R. 2990 , the National Emergency Employment Defense ( NEED Act ) , which articulates why the current debate over the debt ceiling should lead directly to a debate about monetary policy , and the origins of the debt - based economic system .

0	281	UPDATE May 22 , 2018 : 
0	281	 The Little Rock Police Department has recovered human remains in Chalamont Park , the last place Ebby Steppach was seen . 
0	281	 May 25 , 2017 : 
0	281	 Crime Watch Daily joins in the hunt for a missing Arkansas teenager whose parents fear she may have been kidnapped and forced into the dark world of sex - trafficking . 
0	281	 Ebby Steppach , 18 , was planning to go to the Little Rock Police Department to report an alleged sexual assault . 
0	281	 But before she could make talk to cops -- she vanished . 
0	281	 She 's a young woman who has become famous in Little Rock , Arkansas for all the wrong reasons . 
0	281	" "" Everyone knows Ebby , "" said KARK - TV reporter Mitch McCoy . "" "
0	281	 Ebby is the ' Little Rock Girl . ' 
0	281	" You can say the name Ebby Steppach and most people will know who you 're talking about . "" "
0	281	 She went to a house party to kick off the weekend . 
0	281	 But that was the end of the good times for 18-year - old Ebby . 
0	281	" "" Ebby went to a party on a Friday night and had been assaulted , and there was a videotape , "" said Ebby 's mother Laurie Jernigan . "
0	281	 And it 's the beginning of a nightmare for her and her family . 
0	281	" "" She got extremely upset about it and was threatening to go to the police about it . "
0	281	 And then two days later she disappears ? 
0	281	" Yes . "" "
0	281	 And now only Crime Watch Daily tracks down a key witness who sheds light on the frightening possibilities . 
0	281	 Laurie Jernigan says her daughter Ebby is a joy to have around . 
0	281	 But Ebby has an independent streak too . 
0	281	" "" When she started pushing the boundaries , it was ' I have a car of my own , I should be able to come home when I want , ' "" said Laurie . "
0	281	 When Ebby got that first car , a whole new world opened up , and she 's taking the ride all the way . 
0	281	" "" She did n't realize the danger , "" said Laurie . "
0	281	 One night Ebby heads to a party in Little Rock . 
0	281	" "" She did have bad influences on her life , some that I did n't know , "" said Laurie . "
0	281	 The next morning Ebby sends a frightening text message to her friend Gage Fulton . 
0	281	 Gage read the text out loud on a phone call to private investigator Monty Vickers , who recorded the conversation . 
0	281	" "" I was hanging with some dudes last night and we smoked and I had sex with one of them and he [ ----]ing recorded me dude , like when I was n't looking . "" "
0	281	 Videotaped during a sexual encounter -- Ebby does n't tell Gage who did it . 
0	281	 But he tells Vickers that she is horrified and confused . 
0	281	" Vickers : "" Did she tell you that she was raped ? "" "
0	281	" Fulton : "" She said she felt forced into it . "
0	281	" Her last text message to me is ' I am going to go kill myself . ' "" "
0	281	 But Ebby does n't kill herself . 
0	281	 She is enraged , and plans to do something about it . 
0	281	 That same night , she again sends a text , this time to her stepfather Michael Jernigan while he is at dinner with the family . 
0	281	" "" An incident had occurred at that party that she wanted to discuss , and discuss with the police , "" said Michael Jernigan . "" "
0	281	" There had been an encounter with a particular individual at that party that he had videotaped . "" "
0	281	 Michael leaves a message with Ebby that he 's heading to her grandparents ' house where she is staying . 
0	281	 But he gets no response . 
0	281	" "" I called over to her grandparents to ask if she was over there . "
0	281	" They stated that she left , said that she was going to meet me , "" said Michael . "
0	281	 But Michael says there had n't been an arrangement to meet anywhere . 
0	281	 And it is the last contact he ever has with his stepdaughter . 
0	281	 But suddenly the family hears from Ebby the next day when she answers a phone call from her brother Trevor . 
0	281	 Like everyone else he has been trying desperately to reach her . 
0	281	" "" She answered and he said ' Where are you ? ' "
0	281	" And she said ' I 'm out in front of your house , ' "" said Laurie Jernigan . "" "
0	281	 So he hung up and says cool and he goes out there and she 's not there . 
0	281	 So he calls her back . 
0	281	 She answers and she says she 's messed up and he said ' Where are you ? ' 
0	281	 And she said ' I 'm in my car , ' and he said ' Where is your car ? ' 
0	281	 And she said ' I do n't know , ' and hung up . 
0	281	" And that 's the last time anyone 's talked to her . "" "
0	281	 And now the family is truly alarmed and terrified for the fate of their Ebby . 
0	281	" "" He called the police immediately , and he said ' You 've got to look for her car . "
0	281	 I know something is wrong . 
0	281	" Something 's happened , ' "" said Laurie . "" "
0	281	" They listed her as a runaway and they were n't going to look for her . "" "
0	281	 No possibility that she just decided to leave town on her own for whatever reason ? 
0	281	" "" She would move out and hang out , which was really unusual , but she would never run away and not talk to her family , "" said Laurie . "
0	281	 And Ebby 's family is searching for her everywhere . 
0	281	 Until days after her disappearance , they suddenly get news that leaves them thunderstruck once more . 
0	281	 Ebby 's abandoned car is reported at a nearby city park by security guard Guy Hooper . 
0	281	 A surveillance image shows her car on the road shortly after she went missing . 
0	281	 But police are not saying exactly where or if anyone was in the car with her . 
0	281	" "" I called Little Rock and notified them that the car had been sitting there for three days , and they had gotten the car and taken it in , "" said Guy Hooper . "
0	281	" "" It was devastating . "
0	281	 I ca n't describe to you how bad that was that night . 
0	281	 Finding her car and not her , you might as well tell me she was dead . 
0	281	" It was unimaginable , "" said Laurie . "
0	281	 And what police find in her car only deepens the family 's fear that something terrible has happened to Ebby . 
0	281	" "" What 18-year - old leaves her cellphone or their clothes ? "
0	281	 Her makeup ? 
0	281	 She spent all of her money on makeup . 
0	281	" Her contact lenses , she ca n't see without contacts , "" said Laurie . "
0	281	 But Laurie says she still can not convince police that Ebby is a victim of foul play and not a runaway . 
0	281	" "" No matter how hard I tried I could not get detectives to do anything about it , "" said Laurie . "
0	281	 Not only that , Ebby 's family says they still do n't know if some of the people who were with her at that party have even been questioned by police . 
0	281	 Stepdad Michael Jernigan says Ebby gave him some names in that last text conversation , but he will not reveal them for fear of jeopardizing the ongoing investigation . 
0	281	" "" I know two of the individuals , "" said Michael . "
0	281	 Do the police know who they are ? 
0	281	" "" Yes . "" "
0	281	 Ebby Steppach , 18 , has been missing for weeks after disappearing on Oct. 25 , 2015 . 
0	281	 And the alarming possibility that she has been sex - trafficked haunts everyone who knows this case . 
0	281	 How does the sex - trafficking work ? 
0	281	" "" They pick up this girl , lock her up in a room , feed her with heroin , keep her doped up , "" said private investigator Monty Vickers . "" "
0	281	" They charge guys to have sex with her , to the point where she is just a zombie slave . "" "
0	281	 The best - case scenario is Ebby is still alive , but being sex - trafficked . 
0	281	" "" That 's the worst - case scenario to me , "" said Ebby 's mother Laurie . "" "
0	281	" If she 's not with us anymore , she 's in peace . "" "
0	281	 The search for any sign of her goes on , with no results . 
0	281	 Ebby 's family hires private investigator and former Little Rock Police detective Monty Vickers . 
0	281	 He says he tries to help the department work better with the family . 
0	281	" "" The last thing that we need to do is to run out here and start our own investigation and interfere with the police investigation in some way , so we basically did nothing other than try to communicate with the police department and stay in communication with the family , "" said Vickers . "
0	281	 But he still does a lot of digging himself . 
0	281	 About five months after Ebby goes missing , he visits security guard Guy Hooper , the man who reported Ebby 's abandoned car at a city park . 
0	281	 We tracked down Guy Hooper ourselves , and he gave us the shocking details about seeing Ebby with two young black men in the park only days before she disappeared . 
0	281	" "" It was late evening , I advised them all , everybody to leave the park , which they did , "" said Hooper . "" "
0	281	 Then a few days later I run into her again with another young black gentleman . 
0	281	 This time they were in the back seat of the car . 
0	281	" And the third time she was back with another couple gentlemen . "" "
0	281	 He 's sure it was Ebby ? 
0	281	" "" Yes sir , "" said Hooper . "" "
0	281	" After I saw the pictures of her later on , of course -- I did n't have a name at the time . "" "
0	281	 And Hooper says he notices one guy in particular , who he says is there all three times . 
0	281	" "" They were hugging , kissing back and forth , "" said Hooper . "
0	281	 Does he remember what these guys looked like , especially the one she was close to ? 
0	281	" "" He was about five - foot - six , five - seven , had long dreads , "" said "
0	281	 And his eyewitness account is about to go ballistic when we show him what we 've brought along with us . 
0	281	 There was a bust involving sex - trafficking that took place in Louisiana but the individuals that were arrested many of them have connection to Little Rock . 
0	281	 We showed Hooper their mug shots to see if he recognized any of them . 
0	281	" "" It 's this middle one on the top and the gentleman on the left , "" said Hooper . "
0	281	 Which individual was the one kissing and hugging Ebby ? 
0	281	" "" This gentleman right here , the guy with the dreads , "" said Hooper . "
0	281	 How positive is Hooper ? 
0	281	" "" About 70 percent . "
0	281	" I 'm pretty sure this was the gentleman that was directly with her , "" said Hooper . "
0	281	 It is a stunning development that could have a major impact on the search for Ebby . 
0	281	 The man with the dreadlocks is Keith Pruiett , 21 , of Little Rock . 
0	281	 Police in Arkansas have not connected him with Ebby 's disappearance . 
0	281	 But Pruiett was recently charged with human - trafficking and promoting prostitution near Shreveport , Louisiana . 
0	281	 Also charged in that case in Louisiana is 23-year - old Gary Jackson of Little Rock . 
0	281	 Gus Hooper also pointed out Jackson as the second man he believes he saw in the park with Ebby . 
0	281	 Both men are currently in jail in Louisiana awaiting trial , and we have been not been able to contact them or anyone representing them . 
0	281	 Little Rock Police have not named either man , or any suspects , in Ebby Steppach 's disappearance . 
0	281	 We do n't know if the Little Rock Police Department has ever seen the potential bombshell evidence that Crime Watch Daily has brought to the table . 
0	281	 So Crime Watch Daily went right over to the station and hand it to them personally . 
0	281	 We could n't get the lieutenant or a detective on camera , but we ran into Public Information Officer Steve Moore out front . 
0	281	" "" I 'm trying to find him and I 'm going to call the assigned detective and give him this also , "" Moore said . "
0	281	 Police say they are actively pursuing the information we provided them . 
0	281	" "" I think there 's a lot more to the story , "" said KARK - TV 's Mitch McCoy . "
0	281	 McCoy from has been on the story since Ebby first went missing . 
0	281	" "" I think that there are a lot of unknowns with this case that sooner or later will come out . "
0	281	" The question is when , "" said McCoy . "
0	281	 McCoy interviewed retired detective Tommy Hudson , who recently worked on the case . 
0	281	 Today Hudson says the investigation is back on track . 
0	281	 He wo n't discuss sex - trafficking , but he does lean toward foul play . 
0	281	" "" My opinion is is somebody has her and somebody 's done something to her , "" McCoy tells Crime Watch Daily . "
0	281	 And Ebby 's family says that they are now satisfied that police are doing everything possible to find their daughter . 
0	281	" "" I have full confidence in who has her case now , "" said Ebby 's mother Laurie Jernigan . "" "
0	281	 I can actually sleep at night knowing that there are those looking for her . 
0	281	" Thank God we have someone now , we have people now that understand that and check on that as soon as they can . "" "
0	281	 Ebby Steppach stands 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs about 110 pounds . 
0	281	 She also may have dyed her blond hair black after her disappearance .

1	282	" People like Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen are reactionaries , Polakow - Suransky told me on "" Salon Talks , "" but they like to hide behind liberal values like equality and secularism when launching attacks on Muslim immigrants . "

1	283	 Transcript : 
1	283	 STEPHEN COLBERT : Folks , I am terribly excited , because she was first a First Lady , then a Senator , then Secretary of State , and I would have bet anything the next President of the United States . 
1	283	 Please welcome Hillary Rodham Clinton ! [ 
1	283	 audience cheers and applause as Hillary Clinton walks out ; she shakes Stephen Colbert 's hand as they greet each other warmly ; a large part of the audience gives her a standing ovation ; she takes her seat on stage to extended cheers and applause ] COLBERT : Thank you so much for being here . 
1	283	 CLINTON : Oh , Stephen , it 's good to see you . 
1	283	 COLBERT : It 's good to see you . 
1	283	 It 's an honor to have you here . 
1	283	 CLINTON : Thanks ! 
1	283	 COLBERT : You have a new book . 
1	283	" It 's called "" What Happened . "" "
1	283	 And I do n't know how else to start this interview , other than saying : What happened ? ! [ 
1	283	 audience laughter ; Clinton laughs ] What happened ? 
1	283	 CLINTON : Well , that 's the question I try to answer . 
1	283	 COLBERT : Okay . 
1	283	 CLINTON : Yeah , because it was the question I asked myself starting on election night . 
1	283	 COLBERT : Mm - hmm . 
1	283	 CLINTON : And I started— COLBERT : What time on election night ? [ 
1	283	 audience laughter ] CLINTON : Ugh ! 
1	283	 Well , as I write in the book : Midnight . [ 
1	283	 shrugs ] Midnight . 
1	283	 COLBERT : Yeah , I remember . 
1	283	 CLINTON : The dark time of the soul . 
1	283	 Midnight . [ 
1	283	 audience laughter ] COLBERT : Yeah , I 'm waiting for it to not be midnight soon . [ 
1	283	 audience laughter ] CLINTON : Yeah , right . 
1	283	 And so I — I was asking it like you just said : What happened ? ! 
1	283	 You know ? 
1	283	 And I figured , maybe I 'd better try to find out , to figure it out . 
1	283	 So that 's why I dove into this book . 
1	283	 It was , ah , very painful and difficult , but , at the end , I really feel like I 've done my very best to lay out what happened so that it does n't happen again . 
1	283	 I mean , that 's my primary goal here is so that it does n't happen again . [ 
1	283	" lengthy audience cheers and applause ] COLBERT : Well , a lot of people have said , "" Oh , I , boy , I wish Hillary Clinton would just go away . "" "
1	283	 CLINTON : Yeah . 
1	283	" COLBERT : "" Just go away . "" "
1	283	 CLINTON : Well , you know , if they take up a collection and send me somewhere really nice— [ audience laughter ] COLBERT : Really ? [ 
1	283	 chuckles ] CLINTON : I might consider it ! 
1	283	 COLBERT : Really ? 
1	283	 Yeah ! 
1	283	 CLINTON : But it , you know— COLBERT : Obama 's on David Geffen 's yacht a lot . 
1	283	 You could go with him . [ 
1	283	 audience laughter ] CLINTON : [ shrugs ] Well , you know , I — I am not going anywhere . [ 
1	283	 massive audience applause ] COLBERT : Well , I 'm glad you 're not ! 
1	283	 CLINTON : So . [ 
1	283	 extended audience cheers and applause ; Clinton smiles and chuckles ] COLBERT : I agree . 
1	283	" At first I could understand some of those calls — people saying like , "" The Republicans are tearing themselves apart ; do n't give them , you know , someone to rally around in opposition to , "" because you are a convenient figure for them to unite against . "
1	283	 CLINTON : Right . 
1	283	 COLBERT : But I actually do not think that 's how what 's happening to our government is going to be stopped . 
1	283	 I think it 's people who are willing to be civically engaged and believe in the promises and the progress of the last fifty years that will save this country . 
1	283	 CLINTON : I agree completely— COLBERT : So thank you so much for not going away . 
1	283	 CLINTON : —absolutely completely ! 
1	283	 COLBERT : But wait a second : It must not have been easy . 
1	283	 CLINTON : No . 
1	283	 COLBERT : It must not have been easy to write this book . 
1	283	 CLINTON : It — it was n't easy ! 
1	283	 I mean , it was painful . 
1	283	 It was horrible reliving it , and , you know , being as candid , open as I could be about the mistakes I made and talking about those . 
1	283	 But also trying to come to grips , as I write in the book , about everything from , you know , sexism and misogyny , to voter suppression , to the unusual behavior of the former director of the FBI , and the Russians . 
1	283	 And the Russians ! — 
1	283	 and you have been sounding the alarm about this — because I believe so strongly that they think they succeeded in messing with our democracy , and I just ca n't abide that , so— COLBERT : Do you think they succeeded in messing with our democracy ? 
1	283	 CLINTON : Yes I do . 
1	283	 I do . 
1	283	 I do . 
1	283	 Because— COLBERT : To what degree ? 
1	283	 Like , influencing the vote ? 
1	283	 Or influencing opinion ? 
1	283	 CLINTON : Influencing voters , and therefore influencing opinion , I think is becoming clearer and clearer . 
1	283	 I do n't know what the Congressional investigations and I do n't know what the Special Counsel investigation are going to find ; I 'm gon na wait for that . 
1	283	 But I do n't think anybody can with a straight face say that the Russians did not set out to influence our election , and they did so . 
1	283	 This latest revelation about the way they bought ads on Facebook and targeted them — we 're gon na find out a lot more , Stephen . 
1	283	 And I am saying as clearly as I can — I feel like I 'm a bit of a , you know , a Paula Revere ; I 'm trying to sound the alarm about this [ audience laughter and applause ] — is that the— You know , you 've got ta understand what Putin 's strategy is . 
1	283	 He really does n't like democracy . 
1	283	 He thinks it 's an inconvenient , messy process . 
1	283	 And he does n't like us , and he wants to destabilize our country ; sow doubt about our democracy . 
1	283	 I mean , these latest revelations , where you had Russians pretending to be Americans — so you had fake Americans , with fake news , and fake stories , and fake demonstrations — that was n't just because he 's bored and has nothing to do . 
1	283	 He wants to undermine how we see each other , how we respect each other , how we support our institutions and our society . 
1	283	 So , I think that they believe they had a good outing in twenty - sixteen , and I think that they will be back in twenty - eighteen and twenty - twenty , unless we stop them . [ 
1	283	 audience applause ] COLBERT : Now , you mentioned that he — that Putin does n't like democracy and he does n't like America ; part of the speculation is that he specifically does n't like you . 
1	283	 Do you think this was personal on a certain level ? 
1	283	" CLINTON : I think it was mostly about the role I played as Secretary of State , which he did morph into a grudge against me , because I would say things like , you know , "" The Russian people deserve free and fair elections . "
1	283	" They deserve to have a democracy . "" "
1	283	 COLBERT : Questioning the legitimacy of his election in two - thousand eleven . 
1	283	 CLINTON : The parliamentary elections , that 's right . 
1	283	 And , so , our intelligence community and others have said that he did have a personal grudge against me— You know , I do n't take it personally . 
1	283	 I think it 's part of his worldview , which is all tied up with his anger , his disappointment in the collapse of the Soviet Union , and his feeling that we 're his number one rival — he wants to really undermine the European - American alliance . 
1	283	 And so I see it as : I was doing my job — I was honored to do my job , to stand up and speak out on behalf of American values and our democracy — and , partly because I 'm a woman , which does seem to get him a bit agitated— [ audience cheers and applause ] And he actually has said that , um , some things about that— COLBERT : Has he — did he ever say anything to you personally that demonstrated his misogyny ? 
1	283	 CLINTON : Well , he demonstrated— As I write in the book , you know , there 's an expression , we certainly know it in New York , called manspreading . [ 
1	283	 audience laughter ] COLBERT : [ chuckling ] Yes . 
1	283	 CLINTON : And every time I met with him , it would be— [ spreads her arms and flops back in her chair , taking up lots of space ] Okay ? [ 
1	283	 audience laughter ] The whole deal ! 
1	283	 And , so , I 'd go to meetings with him— One in particular , we were in his dacha outside of Moscow , and the press comes in , and he just berates America about one of the many things that annoys him about us , and then the press leaves , and I 've got four or five things we 're trying to deal with him and Russia on — and I always came to my meetings with him trying to find something that I could actually engage him about . 
1	283	 So , we went through the economy and human rights and all these other things that are critically important , and he was , you know— [ mimes staring off into space ] Like , as President Obama once said , like the bored guy in the back of the room . 
1	283	 He could n't care less . 
1	283	" Then I said : "" You know , I am really pleased to hear that you care about wildlife conservation , and that you are trying to save species in Russia , like Siberian tigers and polar bears . "" "
1	283	 Then he came alive ! 
1	283	" And then we had an interesting conversation , so— COLBERT : [ mimicking Putin ] "" I wrestle polar bears ! "" [ "
1	283	" audience laughter ] CLINTON : Yeah ! "" "
1	283	" I wrestle po— "" No , he said to me , so he said : "" Come with me ! "" "
1	283	" He takes me down the stairs , down this corridor , into the door — all of his security guys are jumping up , because we were n't expected — into this inner sanctum with this huge desk and the biggest map of Russia I think exists , and he started telling me he 's "" going here to tag polar bears . "" "
1	283	" And then he says to me : "" Would your husband like to come ? "" [ "
1	283	" audience gasps and laughter ; Clinton grins broadly ] And I said , "" Well , you know , I 'll ask him , but , if he 's busy , I 'll go ! "" [ "

1	284	Shahs of Sunset Recap 
1	284	" With a tumultuous and long - standing feud between Reza Farahan and Golnesa "" GG "" Gharachedaghi finally resolved , the Shahs of Sunset can get back to more important things , like peace in the Middle East . "
1	284	 Just how does a Shah go about tackling the task that has eluded generations of people worldwide ? 
1	284	 By throwing a politically incorrect party , of course ! 
1	284	 Reza and Mike Shouhed nurse their hangovers at lunch , while they recover from Shervin Rpoohparvar 's Malibu party the night before . 
1	284	" Mike never went to bed and when Mercedes "" MJ "" Javid shows up , it looks like she has n't either … .for days . "
1	284	 Talk turns from being hungover to how much Mike 's family means to him and that includes family in Israel that he has n't seen in over ten years . 
1	284	" Hey , would n't it be "" the dope - est "" if all of the Shahs went to Israel too ? "
1	284	 Apparently so , according to Reza . 
1	284	 He is looking to connect with the Jewish side of his life via a posh vacation with his friends . 
1	284	 When they try and get MJ on board , she initially balks , saying she does n't want to leave her father while he is sick . 
1	284	 But she quickly realizes that she needs a break from her stressful life and I guess another cast trip with this bunch of hooligans is something she might find relaxing . 
1	284	 She thrives in chaos after all ! 
1	284	 shahs - of - sunset - recap ( 3 ) 
1	284	 A very pregnant Asa Soltan Rahmati takes a break from talking about her pregnancy to go kaftan boutique hunting with her family . 
1	284	 Just kidding , she is still talking about it , saying that her family business is even more important now that there is another family member on the way . 
1	284	 And everyone knows you can only sell kaftans out of a non - working refrigerator for so long before you have to upgrade to a ramshackled store front , which is exactly what Asa is doing . 
1	284	 The landlord ( and old friend of Asa 's ) shows up in his landlord - y best , which includes a sundress , pink tights , rainbow wig , and nipple eyelashes , that he immediately shows off to everyone . 
1	284	 Is this included in the rent ? 
1	284	 Never mind that , Asa has some sage to burn and twirls of happiness to make around the space so that it is cleansed and ready to sell kaftans . 
1	284	 GG and thousands of her hair extensions are putting good things out in the universe and you know what that means - good things are coming back . 
1	284	 Things like walking in a tacky sequined romper down a runway for some designer no one has ever heard of , I guess ? 
1	284	 Clearly , she must be friends with this designer and clearly , there is a shortage of eligible models for fashion week in L.A. because why else would someone risk having their clothes ripped off incredible hulk style , mid - catwalk if something does n't go Lochnessa 's way ? 
1	284	 I guess only time ( and one fashion show ) will tell . 
1	284	" Reza is shopping for his "" Gaza Strip , Israeli , Palestine , Peace in the Middle East "" party and guys , I can not stress for the life of me the importance of quotations in this recap . "
1	284	 These are Reza 's words , not mine . 
1	284	 With that disclaimer out of the way , back to culturally insensitive shopping , y' all ! 
1	284	 Destiney , who is off the People 's Couch and a supporting cast member now , shows up to help with the decorations . 
1	284	 If this is anything like Mike 's party , Reza should know this is n't a good idea but then again , Reza is n't known for being classy when it comes to décor . 
1	284	 He also is n't known for being culturally sensitive but he explains that being a refugee from a war - torn country , where you can be hung for being gay , leaves him with a desire to poke fun at it as a way of coping with his feelings . 
1	284	 He invites Destiney to the Israel trip since husband Adam Neely ca n't come due to better judgment work . 
1	284	" Destiney also likes "" dope "" things and taking a trip to Israel is one of them , so she happily accepts . "
1	284	 shahs - of - sunset - recap ( 5 ) 
1	284	 MJ , despite not being married , has some marital advice for all of us : you must date your husband until the day you die . 
1	284	 I have some marital advice for MJ : you must marry a man for him to qualify as your husband . 
1	284	 But my advice aside , MJ saying date nights are about romance and making sure your man knows that you still want to have sex . 
1	284	 And how does one send up a smoke signal that you want to have a baby with said man ? 
1	284	" If you 're MJ , you simply tell him "" eff it , I want to get ovulation strip and get pregnant . "" "
1	284	 If you 're fiancé Tommy Feight , your response is something along the lines of surprise , then a brief mention of being more responsible adults before bringing a child into this world , then saying let 's go for it . 
1	284	 MJ reasons that Salma Hayek and Halle Berry did it , so why ca n't she ? 
1	284	 I do n't have the answer to that but my guess would be that neither Salma nor Halle lived in a dirty , one bedroom apartment with no running water . 
1	284	 That certainly would n't preclude you from having a baby but it might make child rearing a little easier , do n't you think ? 
1	284	 With a big bite into a Korean BBQ rib , Tommy says he 's in and vows to stop and get ovulation test strips on the way home . 
1	284	 At L.A. Fashion Week , GG ( not to be confused with Gigi , an actual supermodel ) , has arrived to the show and is already swigging champagne and ordering around hair and makeup like she 's been a horrible person all her life . 
1	284	 Oh , wait … she has ! 
1	284	 Shervin comes to support her but ca n't manage to even have a conversation , thanks to all the naked models in the room . 
1	284	 Within minutes of arriving , GG 's mood gets darker than her raccoon eye makeup after seeing Janice Dickinson , one of the world 's first supermodels , wearing the tacky sequined romper SHE was supposed to be wearing ! 
1	284	" GG is about to throw some murderous vibes into the universe and snaps at the designer to get "" that old a * * b**ch another outfit "" . "
1	284	 Reza and Adam arrive just in time to see this and obviously , ca n't get enough . 
1	284	 Shervin is oblivious because , boobs . 
1	284	" Finally , GG takes a deep breath and says "" fine "" to another equally ugly sequined outfit and the team puts the finishing touches to her glamorous roadkill look . "
1	284	 shahs - of - sunset - recap ( 6 ) 
1	284	 With Lochnessa contained , Reza decides to invite Shervin on their trip to Israel and Shervin takes a pass , saying it would negatively affect some of his business relationships . 
1	284	" Reza is confused and does n't understand why everyone just ca n't join him in feeling "" Jew - y , "" while GG ca n't understand why she would want to go somewhere where they want to bomb Palestinians . "
1	284	 Reza waives off her statement and a symbolic champagne bottle pops loudly in the background , startling them all . 
1	284	" Reza is still trying to get everyone on board and thinks exclaiming "" eff Iran "" out of frustration will do it . "
1	284	 GG is offended but does n't really have time to discuss it further since she has a catwalk to go trip down . 
1	284	 MJ has escalated pretty quickly on the baby fever scale and is already making Tommy pinky swear he wo n't masturbate anymore . 
1	284	" Her plan is to get knocked up and then have a legal wedding ceremony so her babies wo n't be "" bastards . "" "
1	284	 Oh MJ , if only anyone could take your idiotic morals to heart , but it 's so hard when you ca n't even figure out how an ovulation test works . 
1	284	 I know , it 's hard to read directions and pee on something without your fiancé standing over you to help , but I promise , it 's not nearly as hard as taking care of a baby , married or not . 
1	284	 Maybe Salma and Halle are just better at reading directions . 
1	284	 Despite almost clawing Janice Dickinson 's face off at the fashion show , GG is transitioning to a calmer , happier person and that means clearing the toxic energy out of her life . 
1	284	 Or , what normal people would call , moving . 
1	284	 Shervin and Annalise come over to help and thankfully , there are no naked models in the room so Shervin can remain focused . 
1	284	 They quickly find out that GG is n't just harboring toxic energy in her apartment but boxes of old blow up donuts she used to sit on after her butt implant surgery . 
1	284	 Mike arrives and it turns out , his moving company is in charge of moving all the furniture and butt donut boxes . 
1	284	 Yes , Mike opened a moving company and he says it 's not sexy but it 's a solid investment in a business because you ca n't replace movers with robots . 
1	284	 I did n't know you could replace shoes with robots either so not sure why that business got tossed aside but whatever . 
1	284	 Mike does n't even bother to wear his own shoe line to help move and is quickly complaining about scuffing up his new Adidas . 
1	284	 Shahs of Sunset Recap 
1	284	 The night of Reza 's big party and everyone is going all out in costume . 
1	284	 MJ gets ready eating fried rice in her bathroom while getting her makeup done . 
1	284	 At the party house , Reza and Adam arrive , dressed in full Orthodox Rabbi costumes . 
1	284	 Reza muses that since he is more in tune with the Jewish side of his religion , he hopes he can wear the outfit without being disrespectful . 
1	284	" In his next breath , he is showing off his "" sexy burqa bitches , "" who are there to entertain and serve the party goers in headscarves and sequined bikinis . "
1	284	 Mike arrives as Moses , Asa arrives as … pregnant , but claims she is world peace , simply because she draped a white scarf that 's painted with a peace sign around her stomach . 
1	284	 MJ is in a skin tight skeleton costume with side boob and Shervin comes in an orange suit , saying he 's an immigrant from the seventies . 
1	284	 GG arrives in a full burqa and dark sunglasses , all which make it impossible for her to get drunk quickly . 
1	284	 GG still is n't sold on going to Israel and when Reza asks , Shervin also expresses concerns about being welcomed . 
1	284	 Mike promises that Israel is very accepting , but GG pushes back again , saying they are not of Muslims . 
1	284	" It starts to get a little heated but GG 's real issue is Reza 's comment to "" eff Iran . "" "
1	284	 In a surprising twist , Reza immediately apologizes , explaining that he loves everything about Iran but the government . 
1	284	 Asa tries to bring resolution to the conversation by reminding everyone how important it is that they respect each other 's journey . 
1	284	 That 's enough for GG to fully get on board and agree to go to Israel so she celebrates by grinding on Mike , proving that all you need is love and a little dry humping to make the world a better place .

1	285	Sen. Richard Durbin discusses President Trump 's immigration comments following the City of Chicago 's 32nd Annual Interfaith Breakfast commemorating the life of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. on Jan. 12 , 2018 . ( 
1	285	 Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune ) 
1	285	" What did you say when President Donald Trump referred to Haiti , El Salvador and some African nations as "" shithole countries "" ? "
1	285	 What did you say when the president of the United States followed that comment by suggesting he 'd rather see more immigrants from countries like Norway ? 
1	285	 No compatible source was found for this media . 
1	285	 Whether now or in the future , you will be asked this question : What did you say ? 
1	285	 Did you call out the obvious racism behind those statements ? 
1	285	 Did you acknowledge that the leader of the free world — by title , anyway — had shown himself to be a white supremacist , casually expressing his dislike of brown - skinned immigrants and preference for white European immigrants ? 
1	285	 Were you outraged that such comments from a sitting president were antithetical to the ideals that have always made America a beacon of hope and opportunity ? 
1	285	 What did you say ? 
1	285	 Did you speak out ? 
1	285	" Did you denounce the comments , as Rep. Mia Love , a Utah Republican whose parents came to America from Haiti , did , saying in a statement : "" This behavior is unacceptable from the leader of our nation . … "
1	285	" The President must apologize to both the American people and the nations he so wantonly maligned . "" "
1	285	 Or did you keep quiet ? 
1	285	 Take note , because you will be asked . 
1	285	 Trump 's has been a presidency filled with jaw - dropping moments of offensive behavior , but this one will stand out over time , both for its profane nature and its naked racism . 
1	285	 So what did you say ? 
1	285	 Did you look for excuses ? 
1	285	" Did you toss out a "" Well , what about … "" scenario you thought might take the heat off ? "
1	285	" Did you scream something about "" identity politics "" and try to pretend that this is the fault of others , not the fault of the transparently racist old man in the White House ? "
1	285	 Did you say he has a point ? 
1	285	" Did you say , "" Well , those countries are shitholes , are n't they ? "" "
1	285	 Did you forget how people once described immigrants from Italy and Ireland ? 
1	285	 Did you forget the words on a plaque at the Statue of Liberty ? 
1	285	" "" Give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . "
1	285	" Send these , the homeless , tempest - tost to me , I lift my lamp beside the golden door ! "" "
1	285	 Did you forget those words , or just ignore them ? 
1	285	 Did you smile about a tax break and say nothing ? 
1	285	 Did you not put the pieces together and consider all the other times Trump has shown us exactly who he is ? 
1	285	 Did you tamp down memories of his calls for the execution of the Central Park Five , even after the young men , four black and one Latino , were found innocent ? 
1	285	" Did you explain away what Trump was implying in this tweet from 2013 : "" According to Bill O'Reilly , 80 % of all the shootings in New York City are blacks - if you add Hispanics , that figure goes to 98 % . "
1	285	" 1 % white . "" "
1	285	 Did you disregard his years - long birther crusade against the nation 's first black president ? 
1	285	 His description of Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals ? 
1	285	" His regular criticism that immigrants coming from predominately nonwhite nations are examples of those countries ' "" worst people "" ? "
1	285	 Did you not let yourself see the pattern ? 
1	285	 Did you twist logic into knots and blame it on the media ? 
1	285	 On political correctness ? 
1	285	" What did you say when our president called other countries "" shitholes "" and you had to shield your children 's ears from profanity on the nightly news ? "
1	285	 What did you tell your children about this moment ? 
1	285	 How did you explain the president 's words ? 
1	285	 Tell me , what did you say ? 
1	285	 Mark it down , let it be known . 
1	285	 Because you will be asked this again someday . 
1	285	 And if you stayed silent , if you made excuses , if you tried to fool yourself into believing this is appropriate presidential behavior , if you let it slide because this presidency might somehow line your pocketbook , then you will be remembered as complicit , as one who stood by and let America 's decency get dragged through the mud . 
1	285	 And if you laughed , or if you smiled , or if you nodded your head in agreement , you will be remembered just as Trump will : as a racist , a fool and an absolute embarrassment .

1	286	Joel Angel Juarez Las Vegas Review - Journal @jajuarezphoto 
1	286	 The readers of my column are well aware I 'm not a fan of MGM CEO Jim Murren . 
1	286	" I 've called him "" the worst CEO in America "" because he entangled his company in radical leftist politics — including the Council on American - Islamic Relations , an organization tied to terror and called by many experts a front group for Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood . "
1	286	 I actually felt bad for MGM when this tragedy first happened . 
1	286	 But could it have happened to any Vegas resort ? 
1	286	 Or were there factors at play that led to this property being chosen for this terrible mass murder ? 
1	286	 Murren was appointed by Barack Obama to the Homeland Security Council . 
1	286	 From that perch , Murren had insider access to the detailed threats aimed at Vegas . 
1	286	 What did he do to prepare and adequately safeguard his guests ? 
1	286	 Several MGM security guards and ex - security guards have called my radio show in recent days . 
1	286	" They described MGM 's security as "" woefully undertrained and understaffed . "" "
1	286	" One ex - MGM security guard called to say Murren 's first act in taking over Luxor and Mandalay Bay was to disarm most of the guards and declare MGM hotels "" gun - free "" zones . "
1	286	 Maybe that 's why the shooter chose Mandalay Bay . 
1	286	 Why has the timeline involving Mandalay Bay guard Jesus Campos changed so many times ? 
1	286	 Did he approach the shooter 's room before or after the mass murder started ? 
1	286	 If it was before , why were n't the police called ? 
1	286	 Did the shooter choose a MGM property because VIP high roller clients were free to use service elevators , thereby avoiding scrutiny ? 
1	286	 Finally , was the CEO of MGM focused on his properties ? 
1	286	 Was the security of his customers a main priority ? 
1	286	 Or was he distracted ? 
1	286	 SEC records for September reveal more than $ 200 million in stock selloffs from MGM officers and directors . 
1	286	 From July 31 to early September , Murren sold more than 80 percent of his MGM stock . 
1	286	 This certainly paints the picture of a CEO with a lack of faith in his own company . 
1	286	 Or did Murren have one foot out the door ? 
1	286	 Was he distracted and uninterested , perhaps making plans to leave ? 
1	286	 Why else would a CEO sell off a large majority of the shares he owns in his own company ? 
1	286	 Was Murren focused on MGM security as a major terror attack was being planned at his property ? 
1	286	 Or was he too busy selling off his shares , at the right price , into the open market , without Wall Street noticing ? 
1	286	 MGM 's top executives and key board members also sold huge amounts of stock in September . 
1	286	 How about this eye - popping number ? 
1	286	 In the past three months , according to SEC Form 4 , MGM insiders sold off 6,387,163 shares . 
1	286	 Guess how many those same insiders bought ? 
1	286	 Zero . 
1	286	 Also in September , while MGM 's CEO and insiders were selling off huge amounts of their own company stock , MGM announced a billion - dollar stock buyback program . 
1	286	" In other words , they used "" other people 's money "" to buy back MGM stock on the open market to prop up the price . "
1	286	 Talk about the world 's worst conflict of interest . 
1	286	" Shareholders were forced to spend $ 1 billion to buy "" undervalued MGM stock "" at the same time the CEO and his team could n't wait to get out . "
1	286	 Question : What if MGM had used that same $ 1 billion to upgrade security or hire twice as many security staff instead of to prop up its stock price while the CEO was selling ? 
1	286	" Lastly , did Murren sign for a special "" terrorism rider "" on MGM 's liability insurance policy ? "
1	286	" Will a designation of "" terrorism "" vs. criminal mass murder affect the payout from the insurance policy ? "
1	286	 Could declaring this a terror act change MGM 's bottom line by billions of dollars ?

1	288	Put on your tin foil hats , kids — we 've got a conspiracy theory for you . 
1	288	 Is the White House trying to pull a fast one on us by using a Melania Trump stunt double ? 
1	288	 See the ‘ proof ' on Twitter that has voters convinced our FLOTUS is a fraud ! 
1	288	 There 's a lot to dissect here , but first things first : why would the White House need to deploy a Melania Trump stunt double ? 
1	288	 Nobody really knows the answer to that question , but it does n't have anyone less convinced that President Donald Trump had a Melania decoy by his side during a press conference on the White House lawn on October 13 . 
1	288	 The masterful conspiracy theory was posited by intrepid internet explorer Andrea Wagner Barber , who posted a video of the presser on Facebook . 
1	288	 Andrea pointed out that Melania did n't look exactly like herself , and thousands on Twitter agreed . 
1	288	 Watch the video below , and scroll through this gallery of Melania Pics to see if you can spot the difference ! 
1	288	 To the casual viewer half - paying attention to another POTUS and FLOTUS appearance , there 's really nothing amiss about Melania . 
1	288	" It 's when you look closer that you see some subtle differences . "" "
1	288	" Melania "" — if that 's her real name — is wearing massive sunglasses that cover half her face . "
1	288	 Chic , or suspicious ? 
1	288	 Her lips appear to be much bigger and differently shaped . 
1	288	 As some have pointed out , her hair is a little frizzy and dry , far from the pristine condition she usually keeps it in . 
1	288	 Could it be a wig ? 
1	288	 Pay attention to the president , too . 
1	288	" He says , "" My wife , Melania , who happens to be right here … "" Why would he need to point that out ? "
1	288	 Is he letting the world know that this is n't Melania , and the real one 's chilling in Air Force One ? 
1	288	 Thinking about it , this is n't the first time that he 's seemingly been confused about Melania 's whereabouts while they happen to be in the same room . 
1	288	" During their trip to Texas to visit the victims of Hurricane Harvey , he said , "" Melania wanted to be here today "" during a press conference . "
1	288	 Melania was standing directly beside him in her FLOTUS hat . 
1	288	 Did Melania stay home and send out a decoy in her disaster heels ? 
1	288	 Of course , the most logical answer here is that Melania was simply having a bad hair day , wore a little too much lipliner , and on impulse bought a pair of sunglasses that her friends have n't told her do n't work yet . 
1	288	 Or … the conspiracy theorists have a valid point . 
1	288	 Political decoys have been used throughout modern history to protect high - powered individuals from harm , or to attend to duties they can not fulfill themselves . 
1	288	 However , the technique 's been used very sparingly , and most likely would n't work for someone like Melania .

1	291	Will this outrage stand ? 
1	291	 Today 's breaking story of the DOJ surveilling the communications of POTUS Trump 's longtime personal attorney is just now filtering through news watchers across the country . 
1	291	 Remember , the Cohen surveillance was referred to by Special Counsel Robert Mueller , ( and signed off by the DOJ 's # 2 Rod Rosenstein who was the one who originally pushed for President Trump to fire then FBI Director James Comey ) meaning it was effectively Mueller 's operation . 
1	291	 And what THAT means is Robert Mueller was wiretapping the Trump White House . 
1	291	 THIS HAS NEVER BEEN ALLOWED BEFORE . 
1	291	 Early reports indicate at least one direct phone call between President Trump and Cohen was surveilled / recorded . 
1	291	 In a normal world , as soon as the President of the United States was on the line , the DOJ would have initiated an all stop on surveillance . 
1	291	 That has been long - standing ( albeit unofficial ) protocol for decades . 
1	291	 That did n't happen which would indicate capturing the President 's communications to Cohen was the primary purpose of the Mueller - originating surveillance all along . 
1	291	 Consider this that the Department of Justice is charged with upholding the powers of the Constitution but in this case ( and likely many - many others ) it has shredded those same Constitutional protections in order to bring down a duly - elected President of the United States . 
1	291	 When will enough Americans finally stand up and say ENOUGH ? 
1	291	 This is no longer merely about President Trump . 
1	291	 It is n't about Democrat or Republican , liberal or conservative . 
1	291	 This is about America , our personal liberties , and the now - fractured foundation that was the Constitution .

1	294	There has been no shortage of talk recently about taking action to remove President Donald Trump from office , with Trump 's Charlottesville response proving to be a breaking point for many Republicans who had previously supported him . 
1	294	 However , journalist Joan Walsh cautioned Americans to take a long , hard look at Trump 's would - be successor Mike Pence before we get excited about Pence being behind the Resolute desk in place of Trump . 
1	294	" Wrote Walsh in an article bluntly titled "" Why Mike Pence is Worse than Donald Trump "" in The Nation , "" You probably have these debates with your friends , too : Do we want Donald Trump to resign , or be impeached , which would leave us with Vice President Mike Pence in charge? … Would the low - charisma Pence , who looks like a B - movie producer 's idea of a president , be easier to defeat , especially given the GOP fratricide that would commence with Trump 's departure , however it came about ? "" "
1	294	" She continued , "" I try never to care about the political implications of whether Trump should stay or go . "
1	294	 He should go , because he 's a racist authoritarian who got help from a foreign adversary to become president . 
1	294	 He should go , because he 's more likely to stumble into war than Pence is . 
1	294	 But I never let that obscure the truth , either : Pence is a far worse person , because of his creepy Handmaid 's Tale patriarchal approach to women 's equality . 
1	294	" But also because he usually knows he 's lying about Trump , and their administration 's agenda , and he lies anyway . "" "
1	294	 Walsh then brought up disturbing comments the vice president made this past week during an appearance on the Today show . 
1	294	" Said Pence , protesting the removal of Confederate monuments , "" When I walked , back in 2010 , across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with John Lewis , arm in arm , and we remembered Bloody Sunday , and the extraordinary progress of the civil rights movement , I ca n't help but think that rather than pulling down monuments , as some are wo nt to do , rather than tearing down monuments that have graced our cities all across this country for years , we ought to be building more monuments.""Commented Joan about Pence , "" I do n't think he gives a damn about the folks who protest these shameful statues . "
1	294	" What was most galling about Pence 's comment , though , was that he used his bond with Lewis to clean up Trump 's despicable equation of Nazis and white supremacists with their opponents , who are the modern - day incarnation of John Lewis . "" "

0	298	BERKELEY , Calif. ( KCRA ) — 
0	298	 Several fights broke out during largely - peaceful protests in Berkeley Sunday afternoon when about 4,000 people converged on the city , police said . 
0	298	" Thirteen people who ranged in ages from 20 to 47 years old , were arrested for "" various violations "" including assault with a deadly weapon and felony assault during the events , Berkeley police said . "
0	298	 Of the people arrested during the protests , several were wearing masks while others were connected to assaults . 
0	298	 Two men were arrested after exchanging blows . 
0	298	 The SFGate reported they were quickly swept up by officers inside Civic Center Park . 
0	298	 Police detained Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson at the protests . 
0	298	 The SFGate reported he was handcuffed after being chased by a mob of demonstrators who took swings at him and pepper sprayed him . 
0	298	" Police said Gibson was actually "" rescued "" and was not arrested or charged . "
0	298	 The crowd began to diminish around 3:30 p.m. , six hours after a march led to the protests . 
0	298	 The event was one of several rallies that had been called for Sunday in Berkeley , a day after a controversial freedom rally planned by Gibson in San Francisco fizzled amid throngs of counterprotesters . 
0	298	 Hundreds of people gathered on the UC Berkeley campus around 10 a.m. Sunday . 
0	298	 They then marched to Civic Center Park , where police had set up barricades and secured the area with bomb sniffing dogs . 
0	298	 The march was part of the Bay Area Rally Against Hate Rally . 
0	298	" In a statement early Sunday , the group said "" we fully intend to move forward with ( the Rally Against Hate ) "" on the campus despite calls by the university police department for people to stay away for safety reasons . "
0	298	" The rally was held in response to the planned right - wing protest "" No To Marxism in America . "" "
0	298	 However , organizer Amber Cummings canceled the protest on Friday , saying Berkeley officials and left - wing extremists made it impossible to hold the event and she would be the sole attendee . 
0	298	 Despite the cancellation , hundreds of ring - wing protesters showed up to the park . 
0	298	 Around 1 p.m. , police reported the crowd had grown to several thousand . 
0	298	 A skirmish broke out between several dozen left - wing demonstrators and a handful of right - wing supporters . 
0	298	 The skirmish was tense but ended quickly . 
0	298	 The left - wing protesters surrounded the small number of right - wing supporters , then shouted at them and pushed them . 
0	298	 The right - wing protesters sought protection from police and were escorted away . 
0	298	" Before the unpermitted events , Berkeley police put into place several rules in response the protests , stating , "" To ensure the peaceful expression of free speech , the City of Berkeley will be prohibiting sticks , pipes , poles and anything else that can be used for a ' riot ' at Civic Center Park . "" "
0	298	 Other banned items include explosives , pepper spray , axes , dogs ( except for service animals ) , eggs , torches and more . 
0	298	" Police also said anything that "" covers or partially covers the face and shields the wearer 's face from view , or partially from view , is prohibited . "" "
0	298	 However , protesters with an anarchist group arrived at the park wearing masks and hoods that covered their faces . 
0	298	" The group of more than 100 hooded protesters , with shields emblazoned with the words "" no hate "" and waving a flag identifying themselves as anarchist , broke through police lines , avoiding security checks by officers to take away possible weapons . "
0	298	 Then the group blended in with the rest of the crowd . 
0	298	 The group pushed their way past police barricades and into Civic Center Park . 
0	298	 They assaulted at least five people by punching and kicking them . 
0	298	 Gibson was one of the people assaulted by the group . 
0	298	 Police broke up the fights , using what appeared to be a smoke grenade to stop one scuffle . 
0	298	 The three people who were attacked ran behind police lines to escape . 
0	298	 Then around 2:30 p.m. , more than 1,000 people left the park and began marching north Martin Luther King Way . 
0	298	 An hour later , the crowd had diminished and many roads reopened .

1	299	Donald Trump 
1	299	 There is apparently nothing wrong with America that ca n't be blamed on Donald Trump . 
1	299	 He is single - handedly destroying the Republican Party , trashing presidential debates and spoiling the reputation of locker - room talk . 
1	299	 And — breaking news alert ! — 
1	299	 Trump is even changing journalism . 
1	299	 His habit of saying things that nobody ever said before is forcing reporters to unleash their partisan views instead of just giving the facts . 
1	299	 Some of these charges may be true , but the one about Trump changing journalism is demonstrably false . 
1	299	 All the more so because it comes from the editor of the New York Times , who happens to be the actual guilty party . 
1	299	 Dean Baquet , the Gray Lady 's boss for two years , recently claimed that Trump 's campaign had forced the paper into a new way of covering politics . 
1	299	" "" I think that he 's challenged our language , "" Baquet told an interviewer . "" "
1	299	" He will have changed journalism , he really will have . "" "
1	299	 The claim is presented as one of those chin - stroking insights about a new paradigm that liberals spot around every corner . 
1	299	 In fact , it is just another example of the Times getting it all wrong . 
1	299	 Trump did n't change the Times — Baquet did . 
1	299	 He 's the one who authorized reporters to abandon the paper 's standards when covering Trump and express their personal political opinions . 
1	299	" Or , as Baquet said in the interview with Nieman Lab 's Ken Doctor , the struggle for fairness is over . "" "
1	299	" I think that Trump has ended that struggle , "" Baquet boasted . "" "
1	299	 I think we now say stuff . 
1	299	 We fact - check him . 
1	299	" We write it more powerfully that it 's false . "" "
1	299	 Fact - checking , of course , is often in the eye of the beholder , and quickly morphs into opinion when there is no restraint or neutral standard . 
1	299	 The result is the paper 's relentless , daily assault on Trump , to the advantage of Hillary Clinton . 
1	299	" Opinions , all uniformly anti - Trump , now ooze from the paper 's every pore , with headlines on front - page "" news "" articles indistinguishable from daily denunciations on the editorial and op - ed pages . "
1	299	 This is not a mere continuation of the old liberal bias that infected the Times , the Washington Post and the broadcast networks for years . 
1	299	 This is a malignant strain of conformity that strips away any pretense of fairness in favor of strident partisanship . 
1	299	 The signal that the Times abandoned its traditional church - state separation of news and opinion came in an article by the paper 's media reporter two months ago . 
1	299	" In his August piece , Jim Rutenberg declared that most reporters saw Trump "" as an abnormal and potentially dangerous candidate , "" and concluded they had a duty to be "" true to the facts , in a way that will stand up to history 's judgment . "" "
1	299	" Baquet , in the interview , cited the Rutenberg piece , saying it "" nailed "" his thinking . "
1	299	" He also said he started "" down this track "" years ago , during the dispute over weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , and made it clear he believed then - President George W. Bush and then - Secretary of State Colin Powell lied to take America to war . "
1	299	 The Trump treatment , he said , was a logical extension : 
1	299	" "" I think he gave us courage , if you will . "
1	299	" I think he made us — forced us , because he does it so often , to get comfortable with saying something is false . "" "
1	299	 This is not a mere continuation of the old liberal bias that infected the Times , the Washington Post and the broadcast networks for years . 
1	299	 This is a malignant strain of conformity that strips away any pretense of fairness in favor of strident partisanship . 
1	299	 Baquet offered another example that got him to this point . 
1	299	" He accused Republicans of lying in their "" swift - boat "" charges against Democratic nominee John Kerry in the 2004 campaign . "
1	299	 It is not incidental that his examples all involve allegedly dishonest Republicans , and none involves dishonest Democrats . 
1	299	 Nothing better explains why the Times fails to give Clinton the same scrutiny it gives Trump . 
1	299	 More than 60 percent of voters regard her as fundamentally dishonest , but Baquet sees only Republicans as liars . 
1	299	 Simply put , his political bias precludes fair journalism . 
1	299	 And once standards are gone , they are gone forever , meaning anyone wanting to work at the Times will face a political litmus test . 
1	299	 Baquet 's defense of slanted coverage is reflected in the trove of emails WikiLeaks released from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta . 
1	299	 Times reporters and columnists repeatedly show up in partisan ways . 
1	299	 Washington correspondent John Harwood sends Podesta his private approval of Hillary Clinton appearances , as if he 's on the team . 
1	299	 Columnist Nicholas Kristof , in advance of an interview with Bill Clinton , emails his questions , which Podesta 's team passes around to staffers to shape Clinton 's answers . 
1	299	 A Washington reporter gives Hillary Clinton veto power over quotations he can use from an interview . 
1	299	" Another reporter is praised as someone who has "" never disappointed "" in delivering stories the campaign wants "" teed up "" for public consumption . "
1	299	 As the editor , Baquet should be outraged that his staff secretly compromised the paper 's integrity . 
1	299	 But as the editor who eliminated the Times ' standards , he 's getting the biased paper he wanted . 
1	299	 Questions for de Blasio 
1	299	 Mayor Bill de Blasio wo n't take questions from The Post these days , so here are questions all City Hall reporters should insist he answer . 
1	299	 No . 
1	299	 1 : Has the mayor or his lawyer been informed that de Blasio is a target of federal and state investigations ? 
1	299	 No . 
1	299	 2 : Has the mayor been ordered to testify before a grand jury ? 
1	299	 Has he voluntarily offered to do so ? 
1	299	 No . 
1	299	 3 : Did the mayor ask teachers union president Michael Mulgrew for the $ 350,000 contribution the union gave to de Blasio 's political slush fund , the Campaign for One New York , a month before the union got a $ 9 billion contract ? 
1	299	 No . 
1	299	 4 : Did de Blasio or his wife , Chirlane McCray , personally receive any money , gifts or other things of significant value from the consultants paid millions of dollars by the Campaign for One New York ? 
1	299	 No . 
1	299	 5 : Who is paying the legal fees of de Blasio and City Hall aides ? 
1	299	 How much , if any , taxpayer money has been spent representing them ? 
1	299	 The public has a right to know what the mayor knows about the investigations , including the possibility he will face criminal charges . 
1	299	 The reporters in Room 9 , the legendary home of the City Hall press corps , should ask these questions every day until they get answers . 
1	299	 Hill corruption is e - asy to see 
1	299	 Reading the emails hacked from John Podesta 's account , I felt squeamish . 
1	299	 But two facts settled my stomach . 
1	299	 First , the emails reveal the greed and backstabbing among the Clinton clan . 
1	299	 There is no honor among those thieves . 
1	299	 Second , the claim that the messages are forged or a Russian plot illustrate how the family fudges facts it ca n't deny . 
1	299	 That means the emails offer the unvarnished truth , making them unique in Clinton land . 
1	299	 Dem 's truth on voter fraud 
1	299	 Alan Schulkin will never eat lunch in New York again . 
1	299	" The Manhattan Democratic representative on the city 's Board of Elections was caught telling an inconvenient truth , saying , "" I think there is a lot of voter fraud . "" "
1	299	 Schulkin was being secretly taped by an undercover journalist , so maybe his party will forgive him for saying what everybody knows to be true . 
1	299	 Otherwise , he 's going to be a very hungry man .The New York Times abandoned its integrity just to bash Donald Trump
1	300	RUSH : I used to read The Economist . 
1	300	 It 's a British magazine that focuses on economic matters . 
1	300	 It 's also a journal of opinion disguised , and my memory is that The Economist -- and I 'm talking 20 years ago , now , 25 years . 
1	300	 I have n't read it in a long , long time . 
1	300	 It used to be approved reading by the intellectual right . 
1	300	 My memory was that it was valuable here and there . 
1	300	 It had some decent insight . 
1	300	 But they 're gone . 
1	300	 Look at this : The Economist explains how Donald Trump may be making life easier for MS-13 , the street gang . 
1	300	 This is very long , typically long . 
1	300	 The Economist 's argument , the point is Trump 's tough talk is encouraging and emboldening the street gang MS-13 . 
1	300	 That 's right ! 
1	300	 Tough talk at the North Korean lunatic dictator ? 
1	300	 That 's just making him bigger ! 
1	300	 That 's just making him tougher . 
1	300	 That 's just steeling his resolve . 
1	300	 Now Trump is doing the same thing -- he 's talking tough on MS-13 -- and what 's happening ? 
1	300	 He 's making them bigger ! 
1	300	 Let me ask you a question : What is the status of illegal immigration in the country today versus when Trump was inaugurated ? 
1	300	 In fact , let 's just measure it year over year . 
1	300	 Illegal immigration is way down , is it not ? 
1	300	 I mean , it 's down by a factor of millions , is it not ? 
1	300	 It is , folks . 
1	300	 Do n't doubt me . 
1	300	 Have we had any significant changes in the law ? 
1	300	 Has there been any comprehensive or otherwise immigration reform or new legislation ? 
1	300	 The answer is , no . 
1	300	 There has n't been any substantive change whatsoever . 
1	300	 How has Donald Trump been approaching the issue ? 
1	300	 Well , since the middle of 2015 , he 's been talkin ' tough on it , and he 's been tellin ' people we 're going to build a wall -- and he 's been telling people that if they come in illegally , we 're going to track them down and we 're going to deport them . 
1	300	 He 's been telling people if they 're here illegally and we find them we 're going to deport them . 
1	300	 The point is Donald Trump has been talking tough on illegal immigration , and what has happened ? 
1	300	 It 's way down . 
1	300	 The number of people trying to get into the country illegally is way , way down . 
1	300	 Now if you listen to the left , Donald Trump 's tough talk on illegal immigration should have them pouring over the border . 
1	300	 Donald Trump 's tough talk on illegal immigration should be making these illegal immigrants and their coyotes and their supporters twice or three times as committed to get in here . 
1	300	 But it 's not working out that way . 
1	300	 Just the enforcement of existing law -- the promise to enforce existing law , the threat to enforce existing law , the commitment to build the wall , the tough talk , the committed talk on the policy -- is actually working . 
1	300	 It is causing there to be a massive , major reduction in the numbers of people attempting to get into the country illegally . 
1	300	 There 's documented evidence that tough talk is working . 
1	300	 Honest , tough talk is working . 
1	300	" Yet , tough talk with Kim Jong - un ? "" "
1	300	 Oh , no ! 
1	300	 It 's going to lead to nuclear war ! 
1	300	" Oh my God , we 're going to die ! "" "
1	300	 Same thing with MS-13 , according to The Economist . 
1	300	 Donald Trump is making life for these gang members easier and easier . 
1	300	 He 's talking tough and he 's just helping them recruit more members . 
1	300	 Now you ca n't have it both ways .The Economist : Trump 's Creating More MS-13 Gangmembers

1	301	 A clearer picture is coming into focus on the Democrat IT scandal that may help explain why Democrats have been so reluctant to condemn the Awans or help the police with the investigation . 
1	301	 It also might explain why former DNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so jumpy lately . 
1	301	 New information about a massive cybersecurity breach , gleaned from a senior House official with direct knowledge of the investigation , implicates the former chair of the House Democratic Caucus , then - Rep . 
1	301	 Xavier Becerra , who is now the attorney general of California and a rising star in Democratic politics . 
1	301	 Xavier Becerra was told by cops his server had major cybersecurity issues re : Imran . 
1	301	 A fake server was given to cops He 's remained silent . 
1	301	 — Luke Rosiak ( @lukerosiak ) September 13 , 2017 
1	301	 This scandal is n't about bank fraud , folks . 
1	301	 Kudos to Luke Rosiak of The Daily Caller for chasing down this story , even as the Democratic media complex either poo - pooed or ignored the growing scandal . 
1	301	 As Ace of Spades noted , at some point the legacy media is going to have the explain to their audiences why they did n't report on this major story all year long . 
1	301	 A secret server is behind law enforcement 's decision to ban a former IT aide to Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz from the House network . 
1	301	 Now - indicted former congressional IT aide Imran Awan allegedly routed data from numerous House Democrats to a secret server . 
1	301	 Police grew suspicious and requested a copy of the server early this year , but they were provided with an elaborate falsified image designed to hide the massive violations . 
1	301	 The falsified image is what ultimately triggered their ban from the House network Feb. 2 , according to a senior House official with direct knowledge of the investigation . 
1	301	 The secret server was connected to the House Democratic Caucus , an organization chaired by then - Rep . 
1	301	 Xavier Becerra . 
1	301	 Police informed Becerra that the server was the subject of an investigation and requested a copy of it . 
1	301	 Authorities considered the false image they received to be interference in a criminal investigation , the senior official said . 
1	301	 Data was also backed up to Dropbox in huge quantities , the official said . 
1	301	 Congressional offices are prohibited from using Dropbox , so an unofficial account was used , meaning Awan could have still had access to the data even though he was banned from the congressional network . 
1	301	 Awan had access to all emails and office computer files of 45 members of Congress who are listed below . 
1	301	 Fear among members that Awan could release embarrassing information if they cooperated with prosecutors could explain why the Democrats have refused to acknowledge the cybersecurity breach publicly or criticize the suspects . 
1	301	 According to the DCNF 's source , the Awans ' use of Dropbox went well beyond casual use . 
1	301	" They were "" funneling of huge quantities of data offsite where it could not be taken back by House authorities . ""Imran Awan Had a Secret Server that Was Connected to the House Democratic Caucus"

1	304	With most rational individuals condemning Kathy Griffin 's reprehensible photoshoot , some dark souls are coming out of the woodworks and showing their true colors . 
1	304	 Most of the country condemned Kathy Griffin 's now - infamous photo shoot holding a fake severed head of President Trump . 
1	304	 The shocking photo shoot prompted a nationwide outrage and sparked debate over whether or not Griffin should be investigated as a threat to national security . 
1	304	 As the Trump family reacted to the photo , it was reported that President Trump 's youngest child—11-year - old Barron — had seen the photo while watching the news and became understandably upset . 
1	304	 The one thing these so - called artists fail to take into account is the impact their message will have on family members of their targets . 
1	304	 It 's incredibly hard to believe that creating images of this violent nature would n't provoke thought into how they will affect families or even the audience . 
1	304	 Not only was Griffin 's photo shoot and full admission of wrongdoing completely unacceptable by anyone 's standards , it was disrespectful to victims of terrorism and their families . 
1	304	 Radical Islamic terrorists are notorious for beheading innocent people — including Americans — for propaganda videos . 
1	304	 By far , the most disgusting social media post came from some guy who apparently won big on Jeopardy over ten years ago . 
1	304	" Ken Jennings took to Twitter and decided to campaign for Dirtbag of the Year . "" "
1	304	 Barron Trump saw a very long necktie on a heap of expired deli meat in a dumpster . 
1	304	" He thought it was his dad and his little heart is breaking , "" the game show winner from 2004 posted on his Twitter account . "
1	304	 He even defended Griffin 's actions , citing — you guessed it — another game show from the ‘ 90s where he said Griffin was known for holding up severed heads .

1	304	 This kind of reaction is absolutely reprehensible , especially under the circumstances . 
1	304	 CNN has since announced that Kathy Griffin has been fired from her job as a New Year 's Eve announcer for the network alongside Anderson Cooper , who also expressed outrage over the violent photo . 
1	304	 With serious reactions to the photo taking place in the United States , opportunists usually crawl out of the woodwork to make a sad attempt at humor . 
1	304	 This was a huge fail . 
1	304	 Attacking a child who was understandably disturbed by the gruesome image of his father 's mock beheading is a new low in our society . 
1	304	" Adding to this creep 's sentiment , Rosie O'Donnell weighed in via her Twitter account , dismissing Barron Trump 's reaction by asking , "" Do you think he saw anything about these 2 heroic men who died defending young girls ? "
1	304	" Hatred promoted by his father?""This was in reference to the two men who were killed in Oregon defending a Muslim girl from an attack . "
1	304	 Regarding which , by the way , President Trump released a statement condemning the act as hatred that has no place in the United States . 
1	304	 It seems like reactions to disturbing incidents like the Kathy Griffin photo expose the true nature of individuals and separate those with compassion for humans — regardless of political belief — from truly heinous people .Game Show Winner Mocks Barron Trump 's Response to Gruesome Kathy Griffin Photo
1	305	Councilor Mike Gaffney Quotes Voltaire About Free Speech , Failed Reporter Buttmunch Billy Shaner Says He Was Quoting A White Supremacist 
1	305	 Want to advertise with Turtleboy ? 
1	305	 Email us at Turtleboysports@gmail.com for more information . 
1	305	 Yesterday Worcester City Councilor Michael Gaffney wrote a letter to Turtleboy about his disgust towards Worcester Magazine Editor Walter Bird for the way Bird sexually harasses and tries to hook up with women who he has business dealings with . 
1	305	 But why did Councilor Gaffney wait until now to release this damning information ? 
1	305	 Well , he was probably mad that Buttmunch Billy Shaner , his newest minimum wage reporter , insinuated in the recent copy of their free newspaper that Councilor Gaffney subscribed to white nationalist ideology : 
1	305	 YIKES : Quoting a white supremacist is not the best look , especially after one of them rammed a car into a group of people , killing one and injuring 19 . 
1	305	 With that in mind , I bring you a recent article in the Worcester Independent Leader by City Councilor At - Large Mike Gaffney blasting city leadership for policies that favor big business and development . 
1	305	 While I felt the article did a fine job portraying his perspective , a friend pointed out something worrying toward the bottom . 
1	305	 Just before the last sentence , there 's a quote overlaying an image attributed to Voltaire . 
1	305	" The quote reads : "" To learn who rules over you , simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize . "" "
1	305	 It is often attributed to Voltaire , although it has been disputed as to whether he , in fact , said it . 
1	305	 A prominent and supremely controversial white supremacist named Kevin Alfred Strom did , however .. Among other things , Strom has denied the Holocaust , advocated for a Neo - Nazi party and pleaded guilty to child pornography possession charge . 
1	305	 The quote kind of takes a different meaning in proper context , I think . 
1	305	 So let me get this straight . 
1	305	 Gaffney gives a completely applicable quote about the dangers of censoring free speech , which he and most other people attribute to Voltaire - the philosopher whose writings most historians agree was a driving force in the American Revolution . 
1	305	 And what does Billy do ? 
1	305	 He goes out of his way to turn this into Gaffney quoting a white supremacist . 
1	305	 For the record , even the far left attributes this quote to Voltaire : 
1	305	 So did people in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo murders : 
1	305	" Voltaire : "" To learn who rules over you , simply find out who you are not allowed to criticise "" # JeSuisCharlie pic.twitter.com/uAK8KF3C6i "

1	305	 — Persia ( ر ) ( @persiatx ) August 13 , 2014 
1	305	 So did Trump 's lucky sperm : 
1	305	 To find out who rules over you , simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize . 
1	305	 Voltaire 
1	305	 — Donald Trump Jr. ( @DonaldJTrumpJr ) April 25 , 2013 
1	305	 This is what you get when you Google image that quote : 
1	305	 In other words , everyone thinks Voltaire said this . 
1	305	 No one knows for sure if he did or did n't . 
1	305	 All we do know is that a random white supremacist from West Virginia also wrote it here 25 years ago . 
1	305	 So obviously Councilor Gaffney has been brushing up on his 25 year old West Virginia white supremacist literature . 
1	305	 Either that or he , just like many progressives and conservatives before him , believe this is a Voltaire quote . 
1	305	 Anyone with a brain could see what Buttmunch Billy was trying to do here . 
1	305	 He does n't like Gaffney because he 's a social justice warrior . 
1	305	" He tries to play if off like he 's just "" reporting the news "" but he does n't do a very good job hiding it . "
1	305	" Keep in mind that the Turtlegram and Gazette called Gaffney a "" slave master "" two years ago for investigating a fraudulent non - profit that just so happened to be run by a black woman . "
1	305	 They act like it 's harmless to throw these labels out there . 
1	305	 It 's not . 
1	305	 And what I love about Gaffney is that he 's not afraid to fire back at these frauds , which is exactly what he did on his Facebook page last night : 
1	305	 Juicy ! ! ! 
1	305	 Walter Bird did n't write the blurb , but his newest employee did . 
1	305	 I 'm sure Walter appreciates Buttmunch Billy dragging him into a world of shit that is Turtleboy blowback . 
1	305	 But what choice did Gaffney have ? 
1	305	 We 're the only media outlet in town that tells the truth . 
1	305	 The rest are clearly against him , so why should he place nice with them any longer ? 
1	305	 Either way , Walter is the editor . 
1	305	 He approved of this . 
1	305	 He allowed his newest employee to insinuate that the Vice Chairman of the City Council quotes white supremacists . 
1	305	 Buttmunch Billy quickly objected on Gaffney 's Facebook page : 
1	305	 Yea Mike . 
1	305	 He did n't actually call you a racist . 
1	305	 He just insinuated that you are inspired by white supremacist literature and freely quote them in order to push your agenda in Worcester . 
1	305	 What 's the harm ? 
1	305	 YIKES ! ! 
1	305	 Instead of just apologizing and admitting he fucked up , Buttmunch Billy doubled down and said that he was NOT insinuating any racism on his part : 
1	305	 Yea dude , no one believes you . 
1	305	 You 're not good at lying . 
1	305	 You do n't go out of your way to research a meme 's origins , and then attribute it solely to a white supremacist , unless you 're trying to tie Gaffney to that particular white supremacist . 
1	305	 We 're not as stupid as you are . 
1	305	 Plus , who cares ? 
1	305	 Yea , there 's no consequences to being tied to a controversial white supremacist just a couple days after one of them murdered a woman with his car . 
1	305	 It 's not like Joe Petty and his mindless followers will use that against him . 
1	305	 Oh wait … .. 
1	305	" "" Councilor Gaffney quotes white supremacist . "" "
1	305	 That 's the story now . 
1	305	 That 's how it will be told from this point forward . 
1	305	 Buttmunch Billy knew this , which is why he wrote it in the first place . 
1	305	 But it 's not his fault : 
1	305	" "" It 's not on me the way partisans choose to use my reporting . "" "
1	305	 See ? 
1	305	 He was just reporting the facts by going out of his way to suggest that Gaffney quoted a Nazi . 
1	305	 Not his fault how people react to that . 
1	305	 Kind of like how people like Billy do n't blame Trump when his supporters do fucked up shit . 
1	305	 Many accused him of racebaiting , but Buttmunch Billy once again disagreed : 
1	305	 Yea , totally not race - baiting . 
1	305	 White supremacy has nothing do with race . 
1	305	 Then things got even juicier : 
1	305	 Busted ! ! ! 
1	305	 Apparently Billy was texting Gaffney wanting to know why a post from one of his trolls named Eric Malouin was deleted : 
1	305	 Notice the face he forgot to crop out after he screenshotted : 
1	305	 That would be fellow Worcester Magazine minimum wage employee 
1	305	 Oh I see now - it was a group effort from Worcester Magazine . 
1	305	 No wonder Gaffney wanted to spill the bins on their boss - they conspire to make him look bad and they got caught in the act . 
1	305	 Nice going Billy . 
1	305	 So that means Lyford was watching this all go down , started screenshotting his boy Eric 's troll comments , and then cried about it to Buttmunch Billy when Gaffney blocked him . 
1	305	 Because Josh was too much of a pussy to confront Gaffney himself . 
1	305	 Sad . 
1	305	 It looks as if the local African - American community was not impressed with their race baiting : 
1	305	 Boom . 
1	305	 Roasted . 
1	305	 Once Gaffney threatened to spill the bins on Walter 's sexting scandal , Billy realized he fucked up . 
1	305	 He 's only been on the job a couple months and his childish vendetta was about to lead to the public humiliation of his boss . 
1	305	" So he was all like , "" Why not focus on my behavior ? "" "
1	305	 Because Walter allowed this to happen . 
1	305	 What you write reflects upon him . 
1	305	 When South Shore Turtlegirl offends large groups of people they go after the brand , not the blogger . 
1	305	 We all own it together .

1	305	 Yea , it 's just a joke Mike ! ! 
1	305	 So I called you a white supremacist . 
1	305	 Big deal snowflake ! ! 
1	305	" His "" friend "" thought it was funny : "
1	305	 At least he understands that without doing stuff like this no one would actually read his columns :

1	305	 He writes about us EVERY SINGLE WEEK . 
1	305	 Or so I 'm told , I do n't read it myself . 
1	305	 My grandmother calls me about it on her landline . 
1	305	 He 's baiting for us to write about him because he 's smart enough to realize that becoming a Turtleboy villain will at least make him somewhat relevant . 
1	305	 But now he 's finally got our attention .

1	306	 They 've forgotten about us .  
1	306	 I do n't remember where I heard this , perhaps somewhere in the small town of Blacksburg , Virginia , but the context was definitely political . 
1	306	 The IRS is always out to get our money - of course the government has n't forgotten about us , right ? 
1	306	 But the more I thought about it , the more I realized the meaning behind that statement . 
1	306	 Since the founding days of the United States , a problem has always been the power balance between small states and big states . 
1	306	 Presently , this has evolved into the local balance between rural areas and urban areas . 
1	306	 I remember hearing in government class how just a dozen or so of the largest cities in the United States could swing the popular vote to one political party and realizing just how valuable the electoral college is to modern politics . 
1	306	 There 's no simple alternative to balancing out protecting the interests of the rural minority and forwarding those of the urban majority . 
1	306	" From the U.S. Census : "" Rural areas cover 97 percent of the nation 's land area but contain 19.3 percent of the population . "" "
1	306	 This is a huge disparity ; how can state governments look out for rural counties when urban counties dominate the political sphere ? 
1	306	 For many in southwestern Virginia , it seems that politicians are always subverting rural interests in favor of the dense , northern urban areas . 
1	306	 Even the President and many other conservatives use this idea of rural areas being left out to win votes . 
1	306	" From his always - rambunctious Twitter account , Trump proclaimed : "" The Democrats in the Southwest part of Virginia have been abandoned by their Party . "
1	306	" Republican Ed Gillespie will never let you down ! "" "
1	306	 In a time of great change and technology around the globe , sometimes it can feel as if rural areas are being left behind . 
1	306	 Given this context , I 'd like to quickly transition to a discussion about the political frustrations surrounding the Confederate flag . 
1	306	 The Civil War was definitely fought over slavery , but does that make the Confederate flag racist ? 
1	306	 Probably . 
1	306	 But I 'd also like to consider what the Confederate flag symbolizes to many in the South . 
1	306	 Growing up , Confederate flags were never really made out to be a big deal . 
1	306	 I remember thinking nothing of the raised Confederate flags on the way to swim meets and camps . 
1	306	 I remember the public outcry throughout the region when the school sent out an announcement banning Confederate attire . 
1	306	 Even recently , right before I came to Stanford , I was driving home one night and pulled up next to a beat - up pickup truck flying two large Confederate flags at a traffic light . 
1	306	 It felt pretty normal , albeit a little strange especially because of the earlier South Carolina flag controversy and the happenings in Charlottesville . 
1	306	 This was the norm . 
1	306	 The problem is just how commonplace these provocative items are in the region . 
1	306	" These rural Southerners , a legislative minority , are painted as villains , outcasts for not seeing these items as strange in such an apparently "" progressive "" society . "
1	306	 This is an issue because first off , no one likes being called a villain , and secondly , to many of these people - who have seen crumbling infrastructure , a stagnating economy and skyrocketing health care premiums ( one of my older teachers always complained about his wife 's new insurance bill under Obamacare ) - are we really that progressive ? 
1	306	 And how high should working out our flag issues be on our priorities list ? 
1	306	 Should we be arguing over a flag when there are places with exactly zero professional medical attention ? 
1	306	 I remember watching the local news and finding out that in nearby Wise County , Virginia , the only time people can receive medical attention is once a year , when a mobile clinic known as the Remove Area Medical arrives . 
1	306	 General health is deteriorating every year as lung cancer and obesity set in . 
1	306	 Things really are n't looking up for the people here . 
1	306	 The fact that a colored piece of cloth is generating the most media coverage instead of a terrible healthcare crisis here is a sort of a slap in the face to the coal miner with permanent nerve damage or the diabetic who ca n't access insulin . 
1	306	" We tend to separate the world into "" us "" and the "" other , "" but we fail to realize that the "" other "" may also be struggling to come to grips with the world too . "
1	306	 There are definitely two sides to the argument , and I 'm not advocating for any position . 
1	306	 There are many parts of the country that need work . 
1	306	 Racism is a huge problem that we need to solve as soon as possible .

0	307	SEATTLE - Seattle police say they arrested three men as hundreds of demonstrators and counter - protesters converged downtown Seattle one day after violent clashes in Charlottesville , Virginia . 
0	307	 The rally organized by the conservative pro - Trump group known as Patriot Prayer — and a counter protest aimed at standing against hate — were planned for Sunday . 
0	307	 A barricade separated the groups of protesters in downtown Seattle . 
0	307	 Police officers stood by dressed in black , riot gear . 
0	307	 Police said they used pepper spray and blast balls to disperse crowds after fireworks were thrown at officers . 
0	307	 Those arrested were a 40-year - old man for obstruction , a 37-year - old man for assault and a 25-year old - man for assault . 
0	307	" "" Solidarity met by hate "" protesters "
0	307	 It all began peacefully enough as hundreds of activists stepped off from Denny Park just before 2 p.m. Sunday afternoon . 
0	307	 Counter protesters included members of the Veterans for Peace , Socialist Party , Washington Federation of State Workers and other groups . 
0	307	" Counter - protesters marched from Denny Park through downtown Seattle to Westlake Park , but many of those protesters were prevented from reaching the "" freedom rally . "" "
0	307	 But some counter - protesters did make it . 
0	307	 During the rally , some of the demonstrators began trying to run past Seattle police . 
0	307	 When that did n't work , they tried taunting the officers with silly string . 
0	307	 As the crowd surged toward police , they were doused with pepper spray . 
0	307	 Council member Mike O'Brien expressed frustration over the crowd being kept away from Westlake Park . 
0	307	" "" Why were n't the demonstrators not allowed to get to Westlake Park ? "" "
0	307	" O'Brien said . "" "
0	307	 I do n't know what the call was . 
0	307	" I 'm not in a position to second guess that at the moment . "" "
0	307	 He added he would like to find out why police prohibited the crowd from reaching Westlake Park . 
0	307	 Many marchers said they were there to simply take a stand , especially after what happened in Charlottesville . 
0	307	" "" They are missing out on the love that exists here on the other side , "" said Rev. Priscilla Paris Austin , pastor of Immanuel Lutheran Church in South Lake Union . "" "

0	307	 Patriot Prayer 's first speaker stated a message from the organizers ; that the incident in Charlottesville was an act of terrorism and should be denounced , and that white supremacists were not welcome at their event . 
0	307	 He called for peace and love and said anyone who attended for racist reasons should leave . 
0	307	 He then said that Seattle and America 's values are inclusive values .

1	308	On Monday ESPN suspended Jemele Hillfor 2 weeks in response to her tweets encouraging NFL fans to boycott anyone who sponsors Dallas Cowboys owner , Jerry Jones . 
1	308	 Hill 's tweet was in response to Jones comments that any player who disrespected the flag would be cut from his team . 
1	308	 In a statement ESPN said , 
1	308	" "" Jemele Hill has been suspended for two weeks for a second violation of our social media guidelines . "
1	308	 She previously acknowledged letting her colleagues and company down with an impulsive tweet . 
1	308	 In the aftermath , all employees were reminded of how individual tweets may reflect negatively on ESPN and that such actions would have consequences . 
1	308	" Hence this decision . "" "
1	308	" ESPN says that it has accepted the apology of Jemele Hill for tweeting that President Trump and his followers are "" white supremacists . "" "
1	308	" Earlier this week , the co - host of ESPN 's "" SC6 with Michael and Jemele "" fired off a series of tweets calling the President a "" bigot "" and "" white supremacist . "" "
1	308	 Hill apologized for her tweets on Wednesday . 
1	308	" "" My comments on Twitter expressed my personal beliefs . "" "
1	308	" She wrote on Twitter . "" "
1	308	" My regret is that my comments and the public way I made them painted ESPN in an unfair light . "" "
1	308	 The network issued a followup statement after her apology and said that Hill has a right to her personal beliefs , but said that they are not reflective of the company 's opinions or beliefs . 
1	308	" "" She has acknowledged that her tweets crossed that line and has apologized for doing so . "
1	308	" We accept her apology , "" they wrote . "
1	308	" ESPN has been under intense scrutiny after they pulled their broadcaster Robert Lee off air "" as the tragic events in Charlottesville were unfolding "" in August . "
1	308	 The Associated Press contributed to this report . 
1	308	 White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is calling for the termination of an ESPN anchor after she called President Donald Trump a white supremacist on Twitter . 
1	308	" "" That is one of the more outrageous comments that anybody could make and certainly is something that is a fireable offense by ESPN , "" Sanders said on Wednesday . "
1	308	" This comes after Jemele Hill , who co - hosts a ESPN show called "" SC6 with Michael and Jemele , "" fired off a series of Tweets denouncing Trump and calling his supporters white supremacists . "
1	308	 EPSN soon issued a statement in response to Smith 's remarks . 
1	308	" "" The comments on Twitter from Jemele Hill regarding the president do not represent the position of ESPN , "" the network said . "" "
1	308	" We have addressed this with Jemele and she recognizes her actions were inappropriate . "" "

1	308	" "" The comments on Twitter from Jemele Hill regarding the president do not represent the position of ESPN , "" the network tweeted from its public relation 's department 's account . "
1	308	" "" We have addressed this with Jemele and she recognizes her actions were inappropriate , "" ESPN added of Hill , a co - host on the 6 p.m. broadcast of the network 's "" SportsCenter "" program . "
1	308	 Hill on Monday had a series of Twitter exchanges with other users that involved her harshly criticizing Trump . 
1	308	" "" Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w / other white supremacists , "" she said in one tweet . "
1	308	" "" Trump is the most ignorant , offensive president of my lifetime , "" Hill added in another post . "" "
1	308	 His rise is a direct result of white supremacy . 
1	308	" Period . "" "
1	308	" Hill added in a third tweet that "" Donald Trump is a bigot "" before going on to deride the president 's supporters . "
1	308	" "" The height of white privilege is being able to ignore his white supremacy , because it 's of no threat to you , "" she said . "" "
1	308	" Well , it 's a threat to me . "" "
1	308	 Some Twitter users on Wednesday praised Hill for singling out Trump , while others lambasted her decision instead . 
1	308	" ESPN is owned by Disney , and neither company elaborated on a possible punishment for Hill , who was on Tuesday night 's broadcast of "" SportsCenter "" like normal . "
1	308	 Former National Football League ( NFL ) quarterback Colin Kaepernick , meanwhile , on Tuesday voiced support for Hill on Twitter . 
1	308	 Kaepernick remains unsigned after playing with the San Francisco 49ers from 2011 to 2016 in a situation that remains controversial in the football world . 
1	308	 The professional athlete began kneeling during the National Anthem last year to protest police brutality and racial injustice .

1	310	A remarkable thing happened recently . 
1	310	 You might have missed it , because while it happened in plain sight , it also happened in increments . 
1	310	 You had to put the pieces together to appreciate the magnitude of it . 
1	310	 You see , America repudiated its president . 
1	310	 This , of course , was in response to that pathetic performance in the wake of the tragedy in Charlottesville , Va. , when he suggested moral equivalence between white supremacists and those who protest them . 
1	310	 In response , America — a pretty broad swath of it , at least — has condemned him . 
1	310	 The reference is not to the shellacking he took from pundits or the reprovals of GOP leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan . 
1	310	 These things were to be expected . 
1	310	 But you did not expect the Chairman and CEO of Merck to quit the president 's American Manufacturing Council . 
1	310	" And Ken Frazier 's departure , which he framed as "" a matter of personal conscience , "" was just the opening salvo . "
1	310	 He was followed through the door by members of that panel and others . 
1	310	 By week 's end , two presidential business advisory groups had ceased to exist and plans for a third had been scrapped . 
1	310	 Members of the President 's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities also resigned en masse . 
1	310	 Meantime , Mar - a - Lago , Trump 's club and de facto presidential getaway in Florida , saw a rash of charities canceling their fundraising events . 
1	310	 The Washington Post listed the Salvation Army , the American Red Cross , Susan G. Komen and the American Cancer Society among those who have chosen to hold their galas elsewhere . 
1	310	 And there is yet more . 
1	310	" Bob Corker , a respected Republican senator who has heretofore sought to engage with the president , raised sharp questions not just about Trump 's competence , but also his "" stability , "" and called for "" radical changes "" in the White House . "
1	310	 Five military chiefs also spoke out against the bigotry in Charlottesville , in a striking reproach of their commander . 
1	310	 Graduates of Liberty University called on fellow alumni to return their diplomas to protest LU president Jerry Falwell Jr. 's support for Trump . 
1	310	 And it was announced that the president would not be attending the Kennedy Center Honors in December , nor host the traditional White House reception for the five honorees after three of them had spoken of boycotting the event . 
1	310	 And really : How toxic are you when Lionel Richie does n't want to shake your hand ? 
1	310	 It seems that a great many Americans reached a moment of decision and reacted as you would have hoped . 
1	310	 Trump and his apologists and enablers should take note , because this does not bode well for them . 
1	310	 For all its powers of law making , war making , budget drafting , and diplomacy , the presidency also embodies the power of moral suasion . 
1	310	" A president uses what Theodore Roosevelt called "" the bully pulpit "" — the honor and prestige of his office — to stand for what is right and remind us to do likewise . "
1	310	 Problematically , that office is occupied now by a man with no moral compass , a man whose only true North is self . 
1	310	 So what happened was sadly predictable . 
1	310	 What was not predictable was this chorus of castigation from such a wide spectrum of American life . 
1	310	 The stunning rebuke offers heartening evidence that we have not yet completely abandoned who and what we are supposed to be . 
1	310	 Again , this is a moment of decision . 
1	310	 Those who chose to separate themselves from Trump declared their values — and character . 
1	310	 Those who supported him did , too .Pitts : President finally gets what he deserves
0	311	The NFL plans to allow the FBI and IRS investigations into the businesses run by new Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam to sort itself out before it decides whether it will take any action . 
0	311	 NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said a report that Haslam might be asked to step down as the investigation into Pilot Flying J continues is inaccurate . 
0	311	" "" There are no such plans , "" Aiello said . "
0	311	 Haslam told the Associated Press on Friday that he will continue to run the Browns . 
0	311	" "" No change , "" Haslam said . "" "

0	311	 Haslam said earlier Friday he wo n't resign from his position as CEO of Pilot Flying J. 
0	311	" "" Why would I step down ? "
0	311	" I have n't done anything wrong , "" Haslam said Friday while speaking at his company 's headquarters in Knoxville , Tenn. "" It still appears to us that this investigation is focused on a very narrow band of a very large company -- questions about how rebates were handled to a very small percentage of our trucking company customers . "" "
0	311	 An FBI agent 's affidavit , which was unsealed Thursday alleges that Pilot Flying J -- the truck stop operator owned by the Haslam family -- engaged in a fraud scheme designed to keep money owed to its customers . 
0	311	 According to the documents , multiple current and former employees of the company told authorities that Haslam , who purchased the Browns for $ 1.05 billion last October , knew of the fraud and was present at meetings where it was discussed . 
0	311	 The NFL declined to comment on the matter . 
0	311	 Haslam released the following statement Thursday : 
0	311	" "" I 've read the affidavits . "
0	311	 I now understand more clearly the questions the federal investigators are exploring . 
0	311	 I maintain that the foundation of this company is built on its integrity and that any willful wrongdoing by any employee of this company at any time is intolerable . 
0	311	 We will continue to cooperate with the federal investigation and continue our own investigation in these allegations . 
0	311	" I value the relationships we have with our customers , our vendors and our team members across this country and regret that they have to go through this with us , but I trust and believe their faith in this company and its principles has never been misplaced . "" "
0	311	 According to The Associated Press , Haslam arrived in Cleveland on Thursday , three days after FBI and IRS agents executed four search warrants at Pilot Flying J company headquarters . 
0	311	" The AP reported that at a Tuesday news conference in Knoxville , Haslam revealed the government is investigating rebates offered by the truck stop chain , but said , "" We believe we did nothing wrong . "" "

0	313	There are not many newspapers that have published positive views on Donald Trump , but the GOP nominee rejected the praise of this one outright . 
0	313	" The Crusader , the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan , leapt to defend Trump in its quarterly issue with a front - page banner headline , "" Make America Great Again . "
0	313	" Pastor Thomas Robb , the Klan 's national director , wrote,""Can America really be great again ? "
0	313	" This is what we will soon find out . "" "
0	313	" In an interview with the Washington Post , Robb embraced Trump 's campaign , but he denied that his opinion piece amounted to a formal endorsement "" Overall , we do like his nationalist views and his words about shutting down the border to illegal aliens . "
0	313	" It 's not an endorsement because , like anybody , there 's things you disagree with , "" Robb said . "" "
0	313	 But he kind of reflects what 's happening throughout the world . 
0	313	" There seems to be a surge of nationalism worldwide as nationals reclaim their borders . "" "
0	313	 The paper quotes Trump 's slogan and features a large photo of Trump wearing the hat , but it does read more like an essay on the nationalist strain of the GOP nominee 's campaign slogan than a traditional endorsement . 
0	313	" "" While Trump wants to make America great again , we have to ask ourselves , ‘ What made America great in the first place ? ' "" "
0	313	" the article continues . "" "
0	313	 The short answer to that is simple . 
0	313	 America was great not because of what our forefathers did — but because of who our forefathers were .

0	314	 That black adolescents receive harsher disciplinary punishments at school than their white peers for the same offenses is troubling enough . 
0	314	 But federal data showing that even at the preschool level black students are nearly four times as likely to be suspended as their white peers is especially shocking . 
0	314	 What it suggests is that racial biases are creeping into classrooms filled with 4-year - olds and that schools are effectively criminalizing black children , particularly boys , when they are barely out of diapers . 
0	314	 Two years ago , federal civil rights officials issued guidance calling on school districts to train their teachers to overcome this problem and showing districts how to recognize and avoid discriminatory practices . 
0	314	 But researchers are just beginning to understand the psychological mechanisms that lead teachers who see themselves as loving , supportive figures to discriminate against minorities . 
0	314	 Chief among these mechanisms , according to a new reportfrom Yale University 's Child Study Center , are racial preconceptions that shape the way the teachers view black boys in particular . 
0	314	 These preconceptions were found to exist in black as well as white preschool teachers . 
0	314	 In the study , the Yale researchers showed teachers a dozen brief video clips of four well - behaved preschool - aged children , two boys , one black and one white , and two girls , one black and one white , working and playing together in a classroom . 
0	314	 Though the children were behaving calmly , the teachers were asked to look for signs of behavior that might become problematic . 
0	314	 A computer program that tracked the eyes of the teachers as they watched the video showed that both black and white teachers watched the black children , especially the boys , longer when looking for signs of trouble . 
0	314	 And when the researchers asked teachers which child had commanded the most attention , 42 percent of them chose the black boy , 34 percent the white boy , 13 percent the white girl and 10 percent the black girl . 
0	314	 In other words , the black boy in this study received far more scrutiny from teachers than his behavior warranted . 
0	314	" This brings to mind the "" driving while black "" phenomenon , in which police officers stop African - American motorists without cause , or stop - and - frisk practices that predominantly single out blacks . "
0	314	" The Yale study is consistent with previous research suggesting that teachers tend to see "" acting out "" by black children as more threatening than similar behavior in white children , and thus deserving of disproportionately harsher punishments . "
0	314	 This is counterproductive on a number of counts , but what 's really at stake here is the future of these children , whose early disciplinary problems put them at greater risk later on of falling behind , dropping out and eventually getting caught up in the juvenile justice system .Racial Profiling in Preschool
1	315	Why Did Mayor Petty Hire Well Known Communist Dan Margolis To Run His Campaign Smear Team And Serve On The Library Board ? 
1	315	 Want to advertise with Turtleboy ? 
1	315	 Email us at Turtleboysports@gmail.com for more information . 
1	315	 Beautiful day outside . 
1	315	 Perfect weather for Worcester 's Mayor Moron , Joe Petty , to do a standout with his communist friend Red Danny Margolis : 
1	315	 Ya got that ? 
1	315	 The mayor of the second largest city in Worcester is working hand in hand with a guy who admittedly is trying to foment communist revolution , and targeted black churches because he believed they were vulnerable . 
1	315	 This ai n't McCarthyism hyperbole either . 
1	315	 Red Danny freely admits it all . 
1	315	 Check out his Wiki page : 
1	315	" "" Dan Margolis was born in Worcester , Massachusetts , in 1976 . "
1	315	 In 2006 he was chair of the New York State Communist Party USA . 
1	315	 In addition he writes for the People 's World , covering local New York City and state issues , as well as events at the United Nations . 
1	315	" He joined the Communist Party USA in 2001 . "" "
1	315	 He has his own page on the American Communist Party 's website . 
1	315	 According to his bio on there , his plan is to support people like Mayor Petty , because this is generally what communists do : 
1	315	" "" The Communist Party can exercise a leadership role by helping to show the importance of electing or defending Democrats as part of an overall strategy on the road towards socialism . "" "
1	315	 Communism only appeals to people in impoverished areas where they have given up and believe capitalism has failed them . 
1	315	 Thus why Mayor Petty seems inclined on making Worcester 's people trapped in cycles of poverty . 
1	315	 It 's why he wants to make Worcester a sanctuary city - so we can lose $ 59 million in federal funding . 
1	315	" Red Danny was pumped when Obama won , and as the chairman of the Communist Party of New York , he gave the following statement , claiming that this was the "" biggest continuation of that revolutionary spirit "" : "
1	315	 Where he expressed how bad he thinks the collapse of communism has been for the Russian people : 
1	315	 Soviet Union obviously had problems , but now there are drugs , poverty , and unemployment . 
1	315	 Life has gotten worse for the Russian people . 
1	315	 Gangsters are running the streets . 
1	315	 Actually , now Communist Parties are voted back to power by the people in such places like Moldova , Belarus , and Chech Republic . 
1	315	 People did n't like the shock therapy that Yeltsin had introduced . 
1	315	 Boris Yeltsin once stood on a tank and protected the legitimate government from armed communists trying to stage a coups . 
1	315	 Naturally Dan is not a fan of Boris Yeltsin . 
1	315	 All of this information is public . 
1	315	 Just a Google away for any responsible leader . 
1	315	 Joe knows exactly who Red Danny is but he employs him on his campaign team anyway because he 's a useful idiot . 
1	315	" One of his "" morons . "" "
1	315	 He knows that Red Danny has his own blog where he makes up lies about Turtleboy Sports raping girls and blah , blah , blah . 
1	315	 He also knows that Red Danny is OBSESSED with Councilor Michael Gaffney . 
1	315	 And together Turtleboy and Gaffney are a HUGE threat to Petty 's grip on the taxpayer 's money . 
1	315	 He ai n't giving that up without a fight , and he has no problem using communist revolutionaries . 
1	315	 There 's a good chance he actually HIRED Dan to write his silly little blogs . 
1	315	 Do n't worry though - within a couple days he 'll write another blog denying that Petty hired him . 
1	315	 He a good soldier like that . 
1	315	 But a picture does n't lie : 
1	315	 Oh , and did we mention that Dan Margolis is also running the failed Turtleboycott campaign that harasses local businesses ? 
1	315	 The same businesses that Mayor Moron claims he wants to attract and keep in the city . 
1	315	 Here 's the best part - he voted for his buddy Red Danny to be appointed to the Library Board on May 31 when he thought no one was looking : 
1	315	 The City Council Tuesday night elected Daniel M. Margolis of 15 Rugby St. to the Worcester Public Library Board of Directors . 
1	315	 Mr. Margolis was one of three candidates who sought to fill a vacancy on the library for for a term that expires on Dec. 31 , 2019 . 
1	315	 Mr. Margolis received six votes , followed by Edward R. Carr who received four votes and Paul DePalo who received one vote . 
1	315	 The two people who Red Danny beat ? 
1	315	 Edward R. Carr has a PhD and is a professor at Clark . 
1	315	 Paul DePalo is a lawyer with 12 years of experience . 
1	315	 Both of them are much , much more qualified than Red Danny , and unlike him they did n't just move here last year after failing to foment revolution in New York City . 
1	315	 Yet Mayor Puddy voted for his unqualified boy . 
1	315	 Because this is how they gain legitimacy in our government . 
1	315	 The rats get in this way . 
1	315	 They sneak in the backdoor when no one is looking , and Petty orchestrates the whole thing . 
1	315	 Not just him either - Councilors Khrystian King , Kate Toomey , George Russell , Tony Economou , and Candy Carlson all voted for him as well . 
1	315	 Every single one of them has the power to Google , and they all read Turtleboy . 
1	315	 They knew EXACTLY who they were voting for . 
1	315	" And yes , you read that right - Sarai "" Titi Ho "" Rivera did not vote to put Danny in . "
1	315	 Even though he 's got her back till the cows come home : 
1	315	 This is the state of the city right now . 
1	315	 People like Red Danny are allowed to serve in our government - an admitted , openly communist revolutionary . 
1	315	" People like Etel Haxhiaj get appointed to the CAC under Petty 's watch , and deny ANYONE who "" supports "" Turtleboy Sports a job they are overly qualified for on city boards . "
1	315	 Make no doubt about it - Petty is the mastermind here . 
1	315	 Red Danny , Etel , Mosaic - these are just his goons . 
1	315	" Because Petty does a great job of convincing everyone he 's this "" nice guy "" because he does n't get his hands dirty . "
1	315	 Some people thinks Gaffney is a dick because he fights his own battles . 
1	315	 Not Petty though . 
1	315	 He just outsources to labor to nudniks with nothing to lose like Red Danny . 
1	315	 But make no doubt about it - Dan Magolis is his right hand man and by far his biggest asset . 
1	315	 This is what a vote for Mayor Moron is a vote for in November . 
1	315	 Vote the Turtleboy Ticket : 
1	315	 Mayor - Mike Gaffney 
1	315	 Councilors at Large : Gaffney , Konnie Lukes 
1	315	 D3 : Davis Assare 
1	315	 D4 : Coreen Gaffney

0	317	 Mr Akpaloo in a recent interview with Abusua Nkommo hosted by Kwame Adinkra said ‘ no Ghanaian will vote for a Northerner to be a President of Ghana ' after the abysmal performance by the former President John Dramani Mahama in the 2016 elections .

1	318	Total shock , no concession speech prepared , Clinton reveals , in European interview . 
1	318	 In a television interview broadcast on Ireland 's ‘ ' Late Late Show '' , former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate , Hillary Clinton , opened up on the unfolding of events on election night 2016 . 
1	318	 Promoting her campaign memoir , ‘ What Happened ' , Clinton described the night and its aftermath as ‘ ' painful '' and ‘ ' so terrible '' . 
1	318	 ‘ ' I would have to go lie down because it was so excruciating '' , she joked to interviewer Ryan Tubridy in a candid conversation , filmed near her home in Chappaqua , New York . 
1	318	" "" I was in a state of shock . "
1	318	" I had not prepared a concession speech , "" the former presidential candidate revealed , explaining that whilst expecting a close result , her campaign remained confident of victory up until early election night returns began to suggest otherwise . "
1	318	 Following a final rally in Philadelphia , appearing with then president , Barack Obama , husband Bill Clinton and celebrities including Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi , Clinton recalled that on the eve of polling day ‘ ' everyone was so confident . '' 
1	318	 [ Donald Trump , meanwhile , was predicting a ‘ ' great victory '' as he campaigned in Scranton , PA on the same day . 
1	318	 ‘ ' We are just one day away from the change you 've been waiting for , for your entire life '' , he told supporters on his final day of campaigning ] . 
1	318	" Whilst discussing the inauguration of President Trump , asked if she wanted to scream , Clinton told RTÉ , "" Oh , I did . "
1	318	 But that was a common occurrence in those days . 
1	318	" You know , scream into the pillow when I saw what was happening . "" "
1	318	" "" I would have been disappointed and really unhappy if I had lost to a normal Republican . "
1	318	 But to lose to someone who I believed profoundly was not ready for the job , was temperamentally unqualified for the job - was such a burden . 
1	318	 ‘ ' I just thought , ‘ I 've let everybody down , I 've let my country down , I 've let the world down . 
1	318	" How did this happen ? "" "
1	318	 Clinton recalled . 
1	318	 Acknowledging the role of the email scandal and various shortcomings in her campaign , Clinton also blamed Russian president , Vladimir Putin , and the propagation of ‘ ' fake news '' as factors in the election of President Trump . 
1	318	" "" I knew there were these other forces at work that needed to be unpacked and analyzed . "
1	318	" It 's not only about what happened , it 's about preventing it from happening again , "" she added . "
1	318	 With links to Ireland since her involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process of the 1990s , Clinton , who ‘ ' segued from imposing political figure to slightly wacky grandma '' according to one reviewer , told Ireland 's RTÉ Television that she was not going to let the experience turn her ‘ ' bitter and cynical '' and that she would use her platform to fight against what she saw as ‘ ' politically damaging '' trends emerging in the US . 
1	318	 Clinton will later this month appear on British television as her book tour continues .

0	320	Imagine spending your life not only in a cage but in a dark recess of someone 's basement . 
0	320	 This was a reality for a poodle named B.B. , who was rescued from a North Carolina puppy mill by animal workers with the Humane Society of the United States . 
0	320	 When she was found last September , B.B. was tiny and had clearly been impregnated over and over again . 
0	320	" "" She was very tiny , and she looked like this helpless creature , "" said Jessica Lauginiger , animal crimes manager at HSUS . "
0	320	 Upon being rescued , B.B. was transported to Cabarrus Animal Hospital along with the animals . 
0	320	 However , she captured the attention of Brenda Tortoreo , the establishment 's receptionist . 
0	320	 Tortoreo told The Dodo : 
0	320	" "" B.B. was in a corner . "
0	320	 She looked pitiful . 
0	320	" She was scared to death … And I said , ‘ That 's the one I 'm going to take home . ' "" "
0	320	 Because B.B. spent her entire life in a tiny cage , she did n't know what to make sense of freedom at first . 
0	320	" "" I put B.B. down on the floor , and she kept going in circles — not running , but walking , "" Tortoreo said . "" "
0	320	 I guess that 's all she knew to do . 
0	320	 I put her in the living room , and to go into the hallway , she would not cross that border [ between rooms ] . 
0	320	 I have two granddaughters who live with me , so I would put her in one of my granddaughters ' rooms , and she was terrified of rugs . 
0	320	" She just wanted off the rug . "" "

0	320	" "" She never knew what sun was , "" Tortoreo explained . "" "
0	320	" She did n't know what grass was , and she was terrified of it . "" "
0	320	 However , space , plenty of cuddles , and an excess of love have resulted in B.B. slowly understanding that her life before was anything but normal . 
0	320	" "" She runs around the house , "" said Tortoreo . "" "
0	320	 She 's eating like crazy — she was originally about 3 and a half pounds , but I think she 's maybe about 10 pounds now . 
0	320	" She loves the grass now , and she loves playing with the other dogs in the backyard . "" "
0	320	" "" About three weeks ago she started licking me — she 'd never done that before , "" Tortoreo added . "" "

1	321	Donald Trump ran on many braggadocios and largely unrealistic campaign promises . 
1	321	 One of those promises was to be the best , the hugest , the most competent infrastructure president the United States has ever seen . 
1	321	 Trump was going to fix every infrastructure problem in the country and Make America Great Again in the process . 
1	321	 That is , unless you 're a brown American . 
1	321	 In that case , you 're on your own , even after a massive natural disaster like Hurricane Maria . 
1	321	 Puerto Rico 's debt , which the Puerto Rican citizens not in government would have no responsibility for , has nothing to do with using federal emergency disaster funds to save the lives of American citizens there . 
1	321	 The infrastructure is certainly a mess at this point after a Category 5 hurricane ripped through the island , and 84 percent of Puerto Rican people are currently without electricity . 
1	321	 Emergency efforts after Hurricanes Irma and Harvey reportedly went very well and Trump praised himself as well and even saw his disastrous approval ratings tick up slightly as a result . 
1	321	 However , the insufficient response in Puerto Rico has nothing to do with Trump , in his mind , and can only be blamed on the people there who do not live in a red state and have no electoral college votes to offer the new president for 2020 . 
1	321	 They 're on their own . 
1	321	 Twitter responded with sheer incredulity at Trump 's vicious attack on an already suffering people .

0	323	 Top Hillary Clinton aides were upset a Muslim man was publicly named as the shooter in a 2015 massacre that left 14 people dead , and a longtime Clinton confidant even expressed regret that the terrorist was n't a white man , according to purported emails released by WikiLeaks on Sunday . 
0	323	 The emails were part of a trove of messages stolen from the gmail account of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta , who has had a long association with the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband , former President Bill Clinton . 
0	323	 The email chain began on Dec. 2 , when digital operative Matt Ortega forwarded a tweet from MSNBC host Christopher Hayes that named one of the shooters in the San Bernardino , Calif. , attack as Sayeed Farook . 
0	323	" Consultant Karen Finney forwarded the email to Podesta , commenting , "" Damn . "" "
0	323	" Podesta responded : "" Better if a guy named Sayeed Farouk [ sic ] was reporting that a guy named Christopher Hayes was the shooter . "" "
0	323	 Farook and his wife , Tashfeen Malik , gunned down 14 people and injured 22 in a terror attack during a holiday party at the Inland Regional Center on Dec. 2 . 
0	323	 The attackers pledged their allegiance to ISIS before dying in a shootout with police later in the day . 
0	323	 But Podesta 's written lament of the shooter 's ethnicity underscores a long - running aversion in the Clinton campaign - and many in the Democratic party at large - to associating terrorist acts with any aspect of the Islamic religion . 
0	323	" In a 154-page debate prep book that was developed two months after the San Bernardino attacks , and also unearthed in the WikiLeaks document dump , topic 47 is devoted to "" Should we call this Islamic terrorism ? "" "
0	323	" Nowhere in the suggested seven - point answer does "" Islamic terrorism "" make an appearance . "
0	323	" Instead , it 's suggested that Clinton call the enemy "" radical jihadists . "" "
0	323	" "" Now , of course there are those who twist Islam to justify mass murder , "" point three begins . "" "
0	323	 But we ca n't buy into the same narrative that these barbaric , radical jihadists use to recruit new followers . 
0	323	" Declaring war on Islam or demonizing the Muslim - American community is not only counter to our values - it plays right into the terrorists ' hands . "" "
0	323	" Point seven states : "" Radical jihadists underestimate us . "
0	323	 We wo n't turn on each other or turn on our principles . 
0	323	 We will keep our country safe and strong , free and tolerant . 
0	323	" And we will defeat those who threaten us . "" "
0	323	" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made a concerted effort to note that Clinton and President Obama do n't use Trump 's preferred descriptive term , "" Radical Islamic terrorism . "" "
0	323	 Obama held a lengthy press conference earlier this year to specifically address why he refused to link Islam and terrorism . 
0	323	 But in the wake of the Orlando nightclub terror attack in June , and amid more Trump prodding , Clinton relented somewhat . 
0	323	" "" Whether you call it radical jihadism or radical Islamism , I 'm happy to say either , "" she said at the time . "" "
0	323	" I think they mean the same thing . "" "
0	323	 The latest email release was the ninth day this month that emails from Podesta 's account were revealed on WikiLeaks . 
0	323	 So far , about 12,000 of 50,000 alleged emails have been released .

0	324	North Korea must denuclearise the peninsula amid World War 3 scares , Counsellor to the President , Kellyanne Conway has warned . 
0	324	" Speaking to Fox News , Donald Trump 's top aide said : "" Well the President 's position , our position on North Korea has never changed . "
0	324	" "" He continues to apply maximum pressure . "" "
0	324	" Ms Conway added that the United States is "" very happy "" to see a more unified effort against Kim Jong - un 's regime . "
0	324	 North Korea news : Trump will continue to apply 
0	324	" She said : "" North Korea must denuclearise the peninsula region and we 're very happy that there seems to be a more unified international effort in this regard , in that pursuit . "
0	324	" "" You see the United Nations resolution on December 22 , very recently , you see the previous resolutions unanimously in support of the United States position with respect to North Korea . "" "
0	324	 Mr Trump 's aide added that North Korea is a threat to the entire world , not just the US . 
0	324	" She said : "" This is key because this President has made clear from the beginning and constantly throughout the first year of his presidency that a nuclearised North Korea is not just a danger and a threat to America , and to any freedom and democracy loving people , but to the entire world and the world is responding . "" "
0	324	" It comes after President Trump threatened North Korea with his "" much bigger and more powerful "" nuclear button following menacing undertones in Kim Jong - un 's speech on New Year 's Day . "
0	324	" Mr Trump wrote on Twitter : "" North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the ' Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times . ' "

0	325	NY Times Reporter Admits Trump More Open to Press Than Obama 
0	325	 Trump better with press than Obama , mainstream reporter says 
0	325	 Kit Daniels Prison Planet.com 
0	325	 President Trump is more accessible to the media than his predecessor , a New York Times reporter admitted . 
0	325	 Credit : Mark Wilson / Getty Images 
0	325	 Compared to former President Obama , Trump is better at giving news conferences and reaching out to individual reporters , the Times Glenn Thrush said . 
0	325	 I do want to give Trump credit on things , Thrush stated during a media panel discussion on Monday . 
0	325	 I think one of the things that I think he s doing better than Barack Obama are these press conferences and his outreach to individual reporters , even for organizations , like my own , that he criticizes . 
0	325	 When Obama had press conferences , he had a single piece of white paper and he had six or seven organizations that he had preselected to call upon , and a lot of them were pretty favorable to him , too . 
0	325	 Thrust added that Trump was more democratic in comparison by taking questions from a variety of reporters without pre - selecting them , including those from outlets who routinely attack him . 
0	325	 As I reported in 2014 , journalists routinely criticized the Obama administration for what they characterized as the worst press access they ve experiences in decades . 
0	325	 Once we lose access , well never get it back , the Associated Presss chief White House photographer , Charles Dharapak , warned colleagues during a 2014 Newspaper Association of America conference . 
0	325	 And the Poynter Institutes Kenny Irby said Obamas chief photographer Pete Souza was more of a propagandist than a real photojournalist because his job was to make Obama look good , make the president look presidential . 
0	325	 And Souza enjoyed access to the president mainstream photojournalists did nt have until Trump took office . 
0	325	 To sum it up , the mainstream media is like a beaten lover who keeps coming back to an abusive relationship : they fawn over Obama despite his war against press freedom while simultaneously attacking Trump despite his clear generosity to the press .

0	328	Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom weighs in on significance behind the FBI reopening the case against Hillary Clinton . 
0	328	 The FBI announced Friday afternoon it will reopen its investigation of Hillary Clinton 's use of a private e - mail server during her tenure as Secretary of State . 
0	328	 The decision comes as the FBI said it is reviewing new information related to the original case . 
0	328	 James Kallstrom , former FBI assistant director , discussed the news on the FOX Business Network . 
0	328	" "" These guys that run the FBI now came to the conclusion that they look like absolute fools and that they 've done a horrible job , they 've thrown the agents under the bus , they discredited the FBI 's reputation , "" he told Neil Cavuto . "" "
0	328	 And I can tell the people listening to you , it 's not the FBI agents , believe me . 
0	328	" It 's two or three people at the top of the FBI . "" "
0	328	 Kallstrom believes the government agency should n't have started an investigation in the first place if it did n't meet certain guidelines . 
0	328	" "" If they were not ever going to impanel a grand jury , that means you really do n't conduct a criminal investigation . "
0	328	 You do n't have subpoena power , you do n't have warrants . 
0	328	 That was apparently apparent early on in this investigation . 
0	328	" I would 've liked to have seen somebody with the integrity not to just conduct an investigation that does n't meet any of the criteria of how the FBI operates , "" he stated . "
0	328	" He added : "" I suspect that they never had a really bonafide investigation because the Justice Department would n't let them do it .Fmr . FBI Asst . Director : Comey 's Professional , Ethical Experience is at Risk"

1	330	 Screen Shot 2015 - 12 - 01 at 10.29.56 AM 
1	330	 Obviously the big story of the day is the massacre that occurred in Las Vegas last night at a Country Music concert , where at least 50 people were killed by a man from a 32nd floor hotel room at Mandalay Bay casino . 
1	330	 Naturally this has already been politicized , with people arguing about immigration , gun control , and all things Trump . 
1	330	 Oh and Hillary said this : 
1	330	 The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots . 
1	330	 Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer , which the NRA wants to make easier to get . 
1	330	 — Hillary Clinton ( @HillaryClinton ) October 2 , 2017 
1	330	 But yea , Trump is the only one who tweets dumb things . 
1	330	 Good thing the democrats gave us a viable alternative in 2016 that we could really get behind . 
1	330	 Those machine gun silencers are a real killer . 
1	330	 Anyway , we have no interest in going all political about this . 
1	330	 Maybe Jay Dub will . 
1	330	 Just not my cup of tea . 
1	330	 What we do is always find the worst people on the Internet and see what they have to say about this tragedy . 
1	330	 Today 's winner is an illiterate drug dealer from Hartford named Allen Lozada , AKA AP El Titere . 
1	330	 Here 's his initial reaction to the mass shooting : 
1	330	 He might not have finished his GED , but he basically sees the world the same exact way 99 % of employees at CNN do - everything is Trump 's fault . 
1	330	 And those crackas who were peacefully watching a concert in Vegas ? 
1	330	 They deserved it . 
1	330	 The whole thing was a big setup to draw attention away from hurricane relief in Puerto Rico . 
1	330	 He was just getting started though : 
1	330	 But he 's one of the good guys because he admits to donating his profits from drug transactions towards disaster relief : 
1	330	 Oh yea , he 's a winner . 
1	330	 And you 'll never guess who his favorite bouncing ball team is … .. 
1	330	 There 's gon na be a lot of talk in the days and weeks ahead about banning whatever guns were used in Las Vegas . 
1	330	 But I think we can all agree that what REALLY needs to be banned are flat brimmed Chicago Bulls hats and anyone who is inclined to wear them . 
1	330	 There are plenty of responsible , law abiding gun owners out there . 
1	330	 But there has never , ever , ever been a decent , law - abiding person who has chosen to wear that thing on their head . 
1	330	 If you know anyone that owns that hat , disassociate with them immediately . 
1	330	 They will only bring you down . 
1	330	 He even rocks the Chicago Bulls winter hat when he 's pouring out some Henny for the homeys in the January : 
1	330	 Easy on the Henny Allen - it 's not good for your bowels : 
1	330	 I know when I die I want people to come to my headstone and drink copious amounts of Red Bull and Henny , the nectar of the hoodrats . 
1	330	" He really misses his boy , who I 'm sure lived a noble and worthwhile life , because now that Sito is n't around , he does n't have anyone to come scoop him up to he can "" turn up on these fuck n words "" : "
1	330	 You can also find Allen Lozada on Deadbeatdirectory.com , with his own profile : 
1	330	" Oh good , he 's a cokehead deadbeat "" dad , "" who allegedly threatened to choke his baby until she turned blue . "
1	330	 Shocking . 
1	330	 Especially considering his overall philosophy on women : 
1	330	 When he eventually gets killed by a cop and SJWs pretend like his death is an actual loss to the community , he wants you to commemorate him by burning Hartford to the ground : 
1	330	 He 's very familiar with the inside of a courthouse : 
1	330	 He lives the good life by cashing in his SSI check for stays at the Marriott : 
1	330	 Last year things were beginning to look up for Allen . 
1	330	 He was trying to stay out of the police logs , and gave himself one Internet cookie for going a full month without stabbing , shooting , or running over someone with a car : 
1	330	 He gets another Internet cookie for going four days sober : 
1	330	" And he 's going legit because the "" feds out here snatching everybody "" : "
1	330	 Also this : 
1	330	 I have no idea what that means , but it sounds important . 
1	330	 VERY important . 
1	330	 Anyway , it is gon na be interesting to see what the killer 's motivation was in Las Vegas . 
1	330	 He shot at a country music festival . 
1	330	 A place that more than likely was filled with people who voted for Donald Trump . 
1	330	 Not saying that 's his motive , but he could 've shot up any large group of people and he chose this one . 
1	330	 Just sayin . 
1	330	 Either way , Allen Lozada is a useless sack of gutterpubes , and the 50 + who died in Las Vegas are much , much bigger losses to society than he could ever be . 
1	330	 We urge you to support the following local businesses . 
1	330	 They provide terrific services for the community !

0	331	Former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft on the outrage over the Clinton email investigation . 
0	331	 With FBI Director James Comey announcing the investigation into Hillary Clinton 's email scandal would be reopened , Former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft weighs in on the backlash as well as the political fallout as Election Day quickly approaches . 
0	331	" "" Well , first of all , I 'm deeply saddened by what 's happened by the Justice Department , "" Ashcroft told the FOX Business Network 's Neil Cavuto . "
0	331	 Ashcroft then brought up claims that the Department of Justice blocked the FBI from using many of the investigative tools available to it in its investigation of the Clinton Foundation . 
0	331	" "" There 's been a pervasive perversion of the Justice Department process over and over again and recent reports like in The Wall Street Journal that suggest that , not only suggest , allege that the Justice Department has denied investigative tools to be used in investigations related to the Clinton Foundation and frankly , the absence of the use of tools that should have been used in the initial investigation of Hillary Clinton . "" "
0	331	" As a result , Ashcroft explained , "" The Justice Department sent the FBI in to investigate the Clinton Foundation with its hands tied behind its back . "" "
0	331	 The fact that the investigation is being reopened now , so close to the election , was not a surprise to Ashcroft , but the result of stonewalling by Hillary Clinton and her staffers . 
0	331	" "" This is n't an October surprise in my judgment , this is the continuity of an issue which had been stonewalled , for which information had been requested which was not fully given and there was an erroneous statement earlier , much to the acclaim of the people who did the stonewalling , that the investigation was over . "" "
0	331	 According to Ashcroft , it is unfair for the Clinton campaign to blame the FBI for the timing of the announcement when the campaign 's stonewalling is ultimately at fault due to its lack of transparency and delays in providing information requested . 
0	331	" "" There 's a sense in which it 's a little disingenuous to be complaining about information coming out late when you are the cause of the information coming out late because of a significant stonewalling effort that 's been unfortunately facilitated by the way in which the Attorney General and others have allowed this particular investigation to be conducted . "" "
0	331	 Ashcroft viewed this investigation as damaging the credibility of the Justice Department he once knew . 
0	331	" "" This is not the Justice Department that I knew , in which I trusted , which I admired . ""John Ashcroft : This is Not The Justice Department That I Knew"
0	332	Chelsea Clinton strikes a pose during the Democratic National Convention in Denver , Tuesday , Aug. 26 , 2008 . 
0	332	 Photos : Chelsea Clinton through The Years Photos : Presidential Daughters Photos : White House Weddings 
0	332	 WASHINGTON Newly leaked emails show consternation among those closest to Hillary Clinton about how Bill Clinton 's business dealings might damage his reputation and potentially affect her presidential hopes . 
0	332	 The emails , posted Monday by the WikiLeaks organization , also give insight into tension and turmoil within the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was serving as secretary of state . 
0	332	 The chief operating officer of the family charity was reported to be threatening to commit suicide over the stress . 
0	332	 WikiLeaks began releasing on Friday what it says are years of messages from the accounts of Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta . 
0	332	 Podesta has acknowledged his emails were hacked , but warned the messages may have been altered or edited to do political damage to Clinton . 
0	332	 It was n't immediately clear who hacked Podesta 's emails , though U.S. intelligence officials last week blamed the Russian government for a series of breaches and leaks intended to influence the presidential election . 
0	332	 The emails that circulated among Podesta , Chelsea Clinton and former Bill Clinton aide Doug Band detail internal tensions that simmered inside the Clinton Foundation and appear to have played a role in Band 's departure from the family charity . 
0	332	 Internal concerns among Clinton family intimates about Band and the private corporate advisory firm he co - founded , Teneo Holdings , have been previously detailed in several media accounts . 
0	332	 But the new emails provide raw glimpses of an apparent power struggle between the Clintons ' daughter and Band , who worked closely for Bill Clinton for more than a decade after the end of the Clinton administration . 
0	332	 In an email exchange from December 2011 , Chelsea Clinton tells Podesta and others - including Clinton adviser and current Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe - that she 's increasingly concerned about Teneo . 
0	332	 The email includes a forwarded news article that alleges that Bill Clinton had collected $ 50,000 a month through Teneo from MF Global , the commodities brokerage formerly run by former New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine , while MF Global was preparing to file for bankruptcy . 
0	332	" Chelsea Clinton told Podesta and others that two people separately came up to her at a London event for the Clinton Foundation to raise concerns that someone representing Teneo clients had been calling members of the British Parliament "" on behalf of President Clinton "" without her father 's knowledge . "
0	332	" Chelsea Clinton said the calls had people in London "" making comparisons "" between the "" profit motivations "" of the former president and former Prime Minister Tony Blair . "
0	332	" "" Which would horrify my father , "" Chelsea Clinton wrote . "
0	332	 Band wrote in an email that Chelsea Clinton seemed more concerned about critical news coverage about MF Global , a derivatives broker , and Band 's advisory firm , Teneo , than published reports about Bill Clinton 's infidelity . 
0	332	" "" I realize it is difficult to confront and reason with her but this could go ( too ) far and then we all will have a real serious set of other problems , "" Band vented in an exchange sent to Podesta . "" "
0	332	 I do n't deserve this from her and deserve a tad more respect . ... 
0	332	" She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she 's doing because she , as she has said , has n't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life . "" "
0	332	 The emails reflect the ascendance of Chelsea Clinton - as early as 2011 - inside the family charity . 
0	332	 The younger Clinton was recently was anointed as the Clinton Foundation 's future leader if her mother wins the presidency next month . 
0	332	 Bill Clinton announced in August that he planned to step down from the charity 's board if his wife becomes president . 
0	332	 Chelsea Clinton will remain on the organization 's board . 
0	332	" Bill Clinton explained in a letter to supporters in August that he would resign and stop raising funds for the charity to eliminate "" legitimate concerns about potential conflicts of interest . "" "
0	332	 Calls seeking comment from the Clinton Foundation and from Teneo , where Band works , received no response Monday . 
0	332	 Also in December 2011 , Clinton Foundation chief operating officer Laura Graham contacted Band to complain that stress she blamed on the former president and Chelsea Clinton was causing her to consider suicide . 
0	332	 Band wrote that when Graham called him , she was in her car parked near the water with her foot on the gas pedal . 
0	332	 He said he dissuaded her from hurting herself . 
0	332	" "" She called me to tell me the stress of all of this office crap with wjc and cvc as well as that of her family had driven her to the edge and she could n't take it anymore , "" Band wrote in an email to Podesta and Cheryl Mills , then Hillary Clinton 's chief of staff . "
0	332	 Graham later departed the Clinton Foundation , taking a new job with the Empire State Development Corporation . 
0	332	 Phone messages left for Graham on Monday received no response .

1	333	"It will be only a matter of days before the Democratic Party press in America starts taking up the suggestion of Chancellor Merkel of Germany that we seek with North Korea a pact of appeasement like the one the Obama administration engineered with the ayatollahs at Iran . "" "
1	333	" I could imagine such a format being used to end the North Korea conflict , "" Frau Merkel told the Frankfurter Allgemeine . "
1	333	" Were Germany asked to participate , the chancellor warned , she would say yes "" immediately . "" "
1	333	 This is a devilish demarche , coming , as it does , at a time when the American administration is seeking to demonstrate its resolve against North Korea 's atomic bomb program . 
1	333	 Frau Merkel 's interview is calculated to short - circuit any refusal on President Trump 's part to certify Tehran 's compliance with the Obama - Khomeini pact . 
1	333	 It is dog - whistling to the New York Times , which is no doubt scrambling to get aboard the Merkel appeasement . 
1	333	 Let 's see if it can bring aboard Mr. Trump 's newest pal , Senator Schumer . 
1	333	 New York 's senior senator , now the minority leader , played a double role in the drama on the Iran appeasement . 
1	333	 Ostensibly he opposed the pact . 
1	333	 Yet he refused to take a leading role in the fight against it , even when opponents sought to have have the pact itself put to a proper vote . 
1	333	 In other words , he took a powder . 
1	333	 That was all the more disappointing because it was clear that if the pact had been put to the Senate it would have been rejected .

1	333	" The Gray Lady suggests that "" many critics now see its value , "" though its editorial fails to name any such critics . "
1	333	 Germany , of course , never gave a fig about what the Congress thought of the pact .

1	333	 The Obama administration took the unratified deal straight to the United Nations , where Ambassador Power voted against the Congress of her own country . 
1	333	" "" It 's presumptuous of some people to suspect that France , Russia , China , Germany , Britain ought to do what the Congress tells them to do , "" Secretary of State Kerry snickered . "
1	333	 President Putin must have loved that line . 
1	333	 Frau Merkel , in any event , is n't waiting for any formal nod in respect of what President Trump wants to do about the Iran deal — or about North Korea . 
1	333	 She 's prepared to leap right into a negotiated settlement with Pyongyang that would , if Iran is any guide , leave its communist camarilla not only entrenched but richer to boot . 
1	333	 This is a moment for President Trump to remember the 30 American states that lofted him to office . 
1	333	" The platform on which he stood described the Iran deal as a "" personal agreement "" between President Obama and his negotiating partners . "
1	333	" It described it as "" non - binding on the next president . "" "
1	333	" Mr. Trump himself promised to "" rip up "" the agreement . "

1	335	Rachel Crooks , Samantha Holvey and Jessica Leeds with documentarian Robert Greenwald ( Photo : Screen capture ) 
1	335	 A total of 16 women joined together Monday to address their stories of sexual assault and sexual harassment at the hands of President Donald Trump . 
1	335	 While many of these women came forward during the 2016 election , the Trump campaign attacked them , their lives and many right - wing activists invented information designed to discredit them . 
1	335	 The three women that spoke earlier to Megyn Kelly sat at a table with documentarian Robert Greenwald of Brave New Films . 
1	335	 He commended the reporters who have investigated the many accounts across all industries about sexual harassment . 
1	335	" "" There was one man that was n't being held accountable — who 's not being called out , "" Greenwald said . "
1	335	 That 's why he decided to create the documentary with the women . 
1	335	" "" It really had an impact on your heart , your soul , your emotions , "" Greenwald said . "
1	335	" He noted that so many women came forward to warn Americans , but "" attention was not paid . "" "
1	335	" Today , Greenwald said "" we know better . "
1	335	" We know a lot better , "" when it comes to predators . "
1	335	" He demanded those in politics to act against anyone of either party not to give anyone "" a pass . "" "
1	335	 Jessica Leeds , Samantha Holvey and Rachel Crooks each introduced themselves , telling story after story of their horrifying encounters with Trump . 
1	335	" "" I have a new dream now that this man will be held accountable for his actions and that future women will not be treated as less than just because they are a woman , "" Holvey said . "
1	335	 Crooks noted that given Trump owned the building in which she worked , she did n't have any power to do anything . 
1	335	" "" Given this hostile work environment , my only solution at the time was to simply avoid additional encounters with him , "" Crooks said . "" "
1	335	 I do realize that in the grand scheme of things there are far worse cases of sexual harassment , misconduct and assault . 
1	335	 But make no mistake , there is no acceptable level of this behavior . 
1	335	 That some men think they can use their power , position or notoriety to demean attack women speaks to their character and not ours . 
1	335	" Which , believe me , is a tough lesson learned . "" "
1	335	 She went on to say that it was only through other remarkably similar accounts that she felt empowered to come forward . 
1	335	" "" Instead , this was serial misconduct and perversion on the part of Mr. Trump , "" Crooks continued . "" "
1	335	 Unfortunately , this behavior is n't rare in our society . 
1	335	 Many women of any background can be victims . 
1	335	" The only reason I am here today is because this offender is the president of our country . "" "
1	335	" She went on to note that Trump had dismissed his "" Access Hollywood "" tape as "" locker room talk , "" but "" having been the victim of such actions , I knew better . "" "
1	335	 She asked that some things should transcend politics and that all people , regardless of position or power be held accountable for their actions , including Trump . 
1	335	 Leeds walked through her disgusting story and further encounter , saying that she never once anticipated being on the front page of a newspaper . 
1	335	" She was "" absolutely destroyed "" by Trump 's election . "
1	335	" "" The United States is a big strong country , "" Leeds said that she thought at the time . "" "
1	335	" We can survive this person . "" "
1	335	 But women kept coming up to her in public and told Leeds their own story . 
1	335	" She said that she had hoped things were better for women in business , but "" apparently I was wrong . "" "
1	335	 When the Harvey Weinstein story hit and woman after woman began to come forward , people were finally being held accountable . 
1	335	" "" Except for our president , "" Leeds said . "
1	335	" She quoted Trump 's White House , who has said that the women are all "" liars . "" "
1	335	" She noted that some are holding men accountable for bad behavior , however , "" our president is not being held accountable for what he is and who he is . "" "
1	335	 Leeds said that this is part of the problem that is happening in Alabama . 
1	335	" Crooks agreed , saying that Trump endorsed Roy Moore because he denied the allegations and it "" worked for him . "" "
1	335	 Lisa Boyne spoke via phone to the press conference , telling her own story of being invited to a dinner party with Trump in the West Village . 
1	335	 She said that he wanted the women to rate other women on a 1 to 10 scale . 
1	335	" While at dinner , the men used the table as a "" casting couch . "" "
1	335	 The women were brought to the table one by one and he told them to walk across the table . 
1	335	 Boyne said that Trump looked up their skirts as they walked by . 
1	335	 She said that John Casablancas ordered her to drink more but she refused and he was bothered by her refusal . 
1	335	 She ultimately excused herself to the ladies room and from the restaurant . 
1	335	 She explained that over the years her story was met with shame and questions of why she was there . 
1	335	 She tried to pitch it to reporters , but no one wanted to hear it . 
1	335	" "" As a parent I was so deeply deeply offended … because he had a son around the age of my son and what sort of values are we teaching our children when we say that something like rape is ‘ locker room talk , ' "" she shouted . "" "
1	335	 And that her husband talking about that is ‘ boy talk . ' 
1	335	 Everybody is normalizing as something that boys and men say in the locker room . 
1	335	 That is the talk of horrible people and Trump keeps staying it to the press pool . 
1	335	 And you 're all taking it in like it 's normal . 
1	335	 It is not a normal way for people to talk . 
1	335	 Why are n't people calling him out on that . 
1	335	 Something that is so horrific — I 'm so fed up of listening to people . 
1	335	 We take it in like it 's nothing . 
1	335	" We should n't teach our boys to talk like this . "" "
1	335	" She went on to say it was "" one thousand times worse that what Al Franken has done . "" "

1	336	President Trump has said that any legislation touching the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program must include a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico . ( 
1	336	 John Gibbins / The San Diego Union - Tribune via AP , Pool ) 
1	336	 One word defined the immigration debate under former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama : amnesty . 
1	336	 Under President Trump , it might be two : chain migration . 
1	336	" "" Our current immigration system fails Americans , "" Trump said at the White House on Thursday "" Chain migration is a total disaster , which threatens our security and our economy and provides a gateway for terrorism . "" "
1	336	 Trump said it again when spelling out what would have to be in a bill to codify the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , ending in March , in order for him to sign it . 
1	336	 DACA protects undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as minors from deportation . 
1	336	 Because Obama created it through executive action , there are questions about its legal and constitutional basis . 
1	336	 Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in September that the program would be phased out for these reasons . 
1	336	" "" Any legislation on DACA must secure the border with a wall , "" Trump remarked after meeting with Republican senators on the issue . "" "
1	336	 It must give our immigration officers the resources they need to stop illegal immigration and also to stop visa overstays . 
1	336	 And , crucially , the legislation must end chain migration . 
1	336	" It must end the visa lottery . "" "
1	336	" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders described the president as reiterating in the meeting with GOP senators the administration 's "" view that any action on DACA must come with action on the president 's immigration reform principles , which were released last year . "" "
1	336	" "" These include a physical border wall on the southern border ; interior enforcement , which includes more ICE and Border Patrol agents ; as well as a crackdown on sanctuary cities ; and reforms to our legal immigration system , like ending chain migration and the visa lottery program in favor of a merit - based immigration system , "" Sanders said at Thursday 's press briefing . "
1	336	" "" Next week , the president is inviting a bipartisan group of senators to the White House to discuss next steps on responsible immigration reform and to continue that discussion , "" she added . "
1	336	" "" Chain migration "" is a phrase used to describe a feature of immigration law that allows immigrants to sponsor their relatives to come to the U.S. Family reunification is responsible for more than two - thirds of legal immigration annually , while less than 10 percent come for primarily employment - based reasons . "
1	336	 Immigration restrictionist argue this produces a mismatch between immigrant skill levels and the U.S. labor force , at the expense of American workers and recent immigrants . 
1	336	 A bill introduced by Sens . 
1	336	 Tom Cotton , R - Ark . , 
1	336	 and David Perdue , R - Ga . , 
1	336	 endorsed by Trump in August , would cut immigration in half in part by limiting family - based immigrant sponsorship to spouses and minor children . 
1	336	 They would like to see something like this provision be part of any DACA deal . 
1	336	" "" Look , if you give amnesty to one or two million illegal immigrants who were brought here through no fault of their own , as kids , you 're going to have at least a couple negative effects , "" Cotton said on Fox News . "" "
1	336	 And one of those negative effects is you 're going to have a whole new chain of chain migration . 
1	336	" The way to control for that negative effect is to stop chain migration . "" "
1	336	" The immigration hawks at Numbers USA have launched a six - figure ad campaign to inform the public and to help the phrase "" chain migration "" take its place in the political lexicon alongside "" amnesty . "" "
1	336	 The group 's president , Roy Beck , uses the words together . 
1	336	" "" While Congress debates yet another amnesty , we want to help Americans visualize how the presence of chain migration categories means that amnesties are never limited to the people receiving them but instead open up lifetime work permits to millions more of their extended family and in - laws , "" Beck said in a statement . "
1	336	 Many of the Republicans negotiating with Senate Democrats on a DACA fix favor more expansive immigration policies than Trump . 
1	336	 Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , for example , was part of the Gang of Eight and is a co - sponsor of the Democrats ' preferred bill for resolving the status of DACA . 
1	336	 Social conservatives helped beat back a 1990s attempt to reduce immigration in part by limiting chain migration on the grounds that family reunification was a pro - family policy . 
1	336	 Many immigrant communities and their advocates also oppose the change , arguing that it is already too difficult to immigrate to the U.S. and , this is , itself , a driver of illegal immigration . 
1	336	" But Graham suggested Thursday that Trump could succeed where Obama and Bush failed if lawmakers were willing to compromise . "" "
1	336	" There 's a bill to be had , "" he said at the White House . "" "
1	336	 If you want it bad enough , we 'll get it and it will be good for the country . 
1	336	 Everybody has got to give a little bit . 
1	336	" But I 've never been more optimistic about an immigration reform proposal making it to the president 's desk right now . "" "
1	336	 Sen. Jeff Flake , R - Ariz . , 
1	336	 has been a persistent critic of Trump on immigration , among other issues , and asked for a place at the table on DACA negotiations when the administration was lobbying him on tax reform . 
1	336	 Still , Flake tweeted in December that he could make some concessions the White House wanted , specifically mentioning chain migration . 
1	336	" "" We can fix DACA in a way that beefs up border security , stops chain migration for the DREAMers , and addresses the unfairness of the diversity lottery , "" he wrote . "" "
1	336	" If POTUS wants to protect these kids , we want to help him keep that promise . "" "
1	336	 Trump has held to these positions even after his split Steve Bannon , who pushed for immigration restrictions when he was working at the White House and has published numerous articles on the subject on his media site Breitbart . 
1	336	 Pressure is building to craft a legislative solution for DACA , as beneficiaries ' work permits are starting to expire and there are concerns about how long it would take to ramp up the program again if Congress authorized its revival . 
1	336	" "" We must BUILD THE WALL , stop illegal immigration , end chain migration [ and ] cancel the visa lottery , "" Trump tweeted Thursday evening . "" "
1	336	" The current system is unsafe [ and ] unfair to the great people of our country — time for change ! ""Under Trump , opposing ' chain migration ' is even bigger than ' amnesty '"

1	338	Are you sick of Republicans ? 
1	338	 Or just right - wingers in general ? 
1	338	 Do you want to send a message to Washington that you are n't going to buy into their racist , sexist , xenophobic , homophobic and classist nonsense for one second longer ? 
1	338	 Then do the very thing that Donald Trump unintentionally encouraged in a recent tweet : Encourage Hillary Clinton to run for president in 2020 ! 
1	338	 Crooked Hillary Clinton is the worst ( and biggest ) loser of all time . 
1	338	 She just ca n't stop , which is so good for the Republican Party . 
1	338	 Hillary , get on with your life and give it another try in three years ! 
1	338	 — Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) November 18 , 2017 
1	338	" I 'm sure this is the part where the Clinton - haters — be they Trumpers , Bernie Bros or anything in between — will say something to the effect of , "" Of course he wants her to run again . "
1	338	" That 's the only way he 'll get re - elected ! "" "
1	338	 Slow your roll there . 
1	338	 Clinton 's poll numbers are n't too good right now ( OK , they 're downright atrocious ) , but there are still four great reasons to consider choosing her as the Democratic nominee in 2020 . 
1	338	 Even better , all but one of them has to do with an emotion that has no place in this season ( which is why I absolutely had to write this article for Thanksgiving weekend ) : Spite . 
1	338	 Delicious , nutritious spite . 
1	338	 1 . 
1	338	 Hillary Clinton is the Winston Churchill to Vladimir Putin 's Adolf Hitler . 
1	338	 I agree with the basic principle of Godwin 's Law : The first person to invoke Hitler in a political debate should normally lose . 
1	338	 The exception , of course , has to be when someone has genuine Hitler - like qualities . 
1	338	 A foreign despot who has invaded neighboring countries and has a right - wing nationalist agenda is about as Nazi - like as you can get . 
1	338	 This is where Clinton offers a quality that no politician in America can beat . 
1	338	 While Republicans are trying to tar her with a bogus scandal connecting her to Russia ( and anyone who believes Clinton did something wrong in the Uranium One deal lacks credibility on all matters political ) , the reality is that no candidate can be better described as Russia 's nemesis than Clinton . 
1	338	 Putin has always hated Clinton because of his innate sexism , which has manifested in his policies , and she certainly did n't endear herself to him by publicly criticizing Russian corruption in 2011 . 
1	338	 As the ample connections between the Trump campaign and Russia or its water - carriers like WikiLeaks clearly demonstrate , the one person we know we can trust more than anyone is the candidate who Putin very obviously did not want to see as America 's president . 
1	338	 2 . 
1	338	 Hillary Clinton being elected president ( at last ) would monumentally piss off misogynistic trolls , and what 's not to like about that ? 
1	338	 I ca n't think of a single political figure in recent American history who has been hated as deeply , or for as long , as Hillary Clinton . 
1	338	 From the moment she emerged on the national stage in 1992 as a distinctly feminist prospective first lady , she has been the target of right - wing wrath woefully out of proportion to anything she has ever said or done . 
1	338	 The reason for this is sexism . 
1	338	 It 's not the chic thing to say right now , but no other explanation really makes sense . 
1	338	 Yes , Hillary Clinton is more centrist than either party likes these days , but why is she singled out for opprobrium here when her husband — who actually served as president — remains popular despite holding the exact same views ? 
1	338	 The same point can be made about the claim that she is corrupt or too establishment . 
1	338	 To the extent that these accusations are valid , they are no more true of Clinton than of the vast majority of politicians from both parties ( especially Trump ) . 
1	338	 At the very least , the next Democratic presidential candidate needs to be a woman — perhaps not Clinton specifically , but certainly a woman , to offset the symbolic gut - punch of the first female candidate getting cheated by an overt misogynist . 
1	338	 And speaking of cheating ... 
1	338	 3 . 
1	338	 By winning the popular vote convincingly in 2016 , Hillary Clinton has earned the right to be considered the presumptive nominee in 2020 . 
1	338	 As I wrote in September , Clinton is the first defeated presidential candidate to win the popular vote without being automatically considered a frontrunner in the next election . 
1	338	 Two of the previous four popular vote - winning also - rans were actually elected in the subsequent cycle ( Andrew Jackson in 1828 and Grover Cleveland in 1892 ) , while two others were widely regarded as frontrunners before dropping out for personal reasons ( Samuel Tilden and Al Gore ) . 
1	338	 Let us not forget that , for all of the smack talk about how poorly Clinton ran her campaign , she bested Trump by nearly 3 million votes . 
1	338	 This was no razor - thin margin of victory , but a decisive expression of the American public 's preference . 
1	338	 In terms of percentage points , her margin of victory was roughly comparable to that by which Jimmy Carter beat Gerald Ford in 1976 or George W. Bush beat John Kerry in 2004 . 
1	338	 She also held Trump to a lower percentage of the popular vote than that garnered by Mitt Romney in 2012 . 
1	338	 4 . 
1	338	 We can expect her to be a good president . 
1	338	 Frankly , the worst thing that can be said about a potential 2020 Clinton candidacy , especially in America 's current cultural and political climate , is that her husband still has n't answered for the numerous sexual abuse accusations against him . 
1	338	 While it may seem unfair for Hillary to be held accountable for Bill 's alleged predations , it can plausibly be argued that she played a role in helping him cover them up . 
1	338	 If that is ever proved beyond a reasonable doubt , she should be given the heave - ho . 
1	338	 Then again , Bill Clinton is also widely associated with the economic , social and foreign policy conditions of the beloved 1990s , and is greatly missed for that reason . 
1	338	 And since few dispute that Hillary was her husband 's co - president during that halcyon decade , that association can still remain a giant advantage . 
1	338	 Finally , and perhaps most importantly , Clinton demonstrated through the 2016 Democratic National Committee platform that she would work with progressives on pursuing a policy agenda very close to their own goals . 
1	338	 On issues ranging from raising the minimum wage and fighting global warming to scaling back the war on drugs , she would stand exactly where the majority of grassroots activists in the party want her to be . 
1	338	 Plus — while this has been noted countless times before , it deserves repetition — she has ample experience as a U.S. senator and secretary of state in actually getting things done . 
1	338	 That ability to get things done , by the way , is why Clinton had high approval ratings as secretary of state ( usually in the 60s ) , even proving more popular than President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden in 2011 and 2012 . 
1	338	" Her stock may be low now , but it 's been low in the past ( such as when she "" ran "" to be first lady in 1992 ) , and it has always recovered . "
1	338	 Arguably the big political question facing a potential Hillary 2020 campaign will be whether that bounce occurs at a fortuitous moment for her . 
1	338	 It very well could , and would n't that be a giant helping of the dish best served cold ? 
1	338	 Did You Know ? 
1	338	 For 20 days , Hillary Clinton was both senator and first lady ; she was sworn in as a senator on Jan. 1 , 2001 , and Bill 's last day in the White House was Jan. 20th . 
1	338	 Did You Know ? 
1	338	 Hillary Clinton is the first First Lady in American history to be elected into national office , serving as both a Senator and as Secretary of State under Obama .Here 's your leftover turkey : The case for Hillary Clinton 2020

1	340	Well , this is odd . 
1	340	 Former President Obama has chosen not to host hard - copy versions of his manuscripts and letters in his presidential library . 
1	340	 Is the former Commander - in - Chief hiding something ? 
1	340	" The move has "" historians scratching their heads . "" "
1	340	 Fox News report : 
1	340	 The Obama Foundation is taking an unconventional approach to the presidential center and library being planned in Chicago . 
1	340	 It 's opting to host a digital archive of President Barack Obama 's records , but not keep his hard - copy manuscripts and letters and other documents onsite . 
1	340	 That means no thumbing through the ex - president 's correspondence on the health care fight or first drafts of his State of the Union addresses . 
1	340	 The decision has historians scratching their heads . 
1	340	" "" All archivists are waiting to see how this will work , because we are all struggling with how to make things available digitally , "" Peggy Glowacki , a manuscripts librarian at the Richard J. Daley Library at the University of Illinois at Chicago , told the Chicago Tribune . "
1	340	 An interesting piece of information to note is evidence surrounding Susan Rice 's role in the ‘ unmasking ' probe have been moved to the future library . 
1	340	 The documents were moved to the Obama Library and under the Presidential Records Act , Presidential records remain closed to the public for five years after an administration has left office . 
1	340	 President of Judicial Watch , Tom Fitton said Wednesday on Fox & Friends that President Trump can obtain these records from the Obama Presidential Library because they are federal records . 
1	340	 Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy said that the President himself could obtain the records if he were to ask for them . 
1	340	" Tom Fitton : "" Yes , they are still federal records . "
1	340	 They are under the control of the national archives and he can get 'em . 
1	340	 If he needs them , then the President can conduct his official duties he can get them , Subpoenas issued by Congress can get them . 
1	340	 Special Counsel Mueller , if he decides to actually investigate real crimes like the unmasking , the illicit surveillance , the leaking - he could get them if he issued subpoenas . 
1	340	" There are options to get these records and they need to be taken because there could be elements of the records in the other agencies , but these are key White House records about what the White House was up to and that to me is as important as anything else . "" "

0	341	 Singer Seal is calling out critics for suggesting he attacked Oprah Winfrey over her relationship with Harvey Weinstein , insisting he was speaking out against hypocrisy in Hollywood . 
0	341	 The Kiss From a Rose star came under fire earlier this week after he took to Instagram to question Oprah 's friendship with the disgraced producer , writing . 
0	341	" "" Oh I forgot , that 's right … you 'd heard the rumours but you had no idea he was actually serially assaulting young stary - eyed ( sic ) actresses who in turn had no idea what they were getting into . "

0	341	 But now the singer insists he was n't trying to discredit Winfrey . 
0	341	" "" Now let 's get straight to it , "" he says in a new video posted on Facebook . "" "
0	341	" Let me start by saying that I have an enormous amount of respect for everything that Oprah has achieved and contributed in her life . "" "

0	341	 She just happened to be the person photographed with the pig ( Weinstein ) in the picture . 
0	341	" No , what I re - posted was commentary on the hypocritical and double standard nature and behaviour of Hollywood … "" "
0	341	" In his message , Seal also slams actress Stacey Dash for tweeting a link to an article about Seal 's original post and writing , "" Ouch , he does make a good point though . "" "
0	341	" "" And Stacey Dash , keep my name out of your mouth , "" he continues . "" "
0	341	 Do not re - tweet , re - quote anything I have said in order to reinforce your self - hating agenda … Again , this was not an attack against Oprah .

0	342	President Barack Obama is set to speak at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night . 
0	342	 Obama will take the stage 12 years after he first came to national attention as a freshman senator from Illinois at his party 's 2004 convention . 
0	342	 Ostensibly , Obama was there to endorse Massachusetts senator John Kerry for his White House bid . 
0	342	 But it 's best remembered as the launching - point of Obama 's own run four years later . 
0	342	 John Kerry believes in America . 
0	342	 And he knows that it 's not enough for just some of us to prosper , for alongside our famous individualism , there 's another ingredient in the American saga , a belief that we 're all connected as one people . 
0	342	 If there is a child on the South Side of Chicago who ca n't read , that matters to me even if it 's not my child . 
0	342	 If there is a senior citizen somewhere who ca n't pay for their prescription drugs and are having to choose between medicine and the rent , that makes my life poorer even if it 's not my grandparent . 
0	342	 If there is an Arab - American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process , that threatens my civil liberties . 
0	342	 It is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief -- I am my brother 's keeper , I am my sister 's keeper -- that makes this country work . 
0	342	" It 's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams , and yet still come together as one American family . "" "
0	342	" E pluribus unum ; "" "" out of many , one . "" "
0	342	 Now even as we speak , there are those who are preparing to divide us ; the spin masters , the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes . 
0	342	 Well , I say to them tonight there is not a liberal America and a conservative America . 
0	342	 There is the United States of America . 
0	342	 There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America . 
0	342	 There 's the United States of America . 
0	342	 The pundits -- the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states , red states for Republicans , blue states for Democrats . 
0	342	 But I 've got news for them , too : we worship an awesome God in the blue states and we do n't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states . 
0	342	 We coach little league in the blue states and , yes , we 've got some gay friends in the red states . 
0	342	 There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq . 
0	342	 We are one people , all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes , all of us defending the United States of America . 
0	342	 In the end -- in the end -- in the end , that 's what this election is about . 
0	342	 Do we participate in a politics of cynicism , or do we participate in a politics of hope ? 
0	342	 John Kerry calls on us to hope . 
0	342	 John Edwards calls on us to hope . 
0	342	 I 'm not talking about blind optimism here , the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just do n't think about it , or a health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it . 
0	342	 That 's not what I 'm talking about . 
0	342	 I 'm talking about something more substantial . 
0	342	 It 's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs . 
0	342	 The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores . 
0	342	 The hope of a young Naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta . 
0	342	 The hope of a millworker 's son who dares to defy the odds . 
0	342	 The hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him too . ( 
0	342	 Hope -- hope in the face of difficulty . 
0	342	 Hope in the face of uncertainty . 
0	342	 The audacity of hope . 
0	342	 In the end , that is God 's greatest gift to us , the bedrock of this nation , a belief in things not seen ; a belief that there are better days ahead . 
0	342	 I believe that we can give our middle class relief , and provide working families with a road to opportunity . 
0	342	 I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless , homes to the homeless , and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair . 
0	342	 I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs , and that as we stand on the crossroads of history , we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us . 
0	342	 America , tonight , if you feel the same energy that I do , if you feel the same urgency that I do , if you feel the same passion that I do , if you feel the same hopefulness that I do , if we do what we must do , then I have no doubt that all across the country , from Florida to Oregon , from Washington to Maine , the people will rise up in November , and John Kerry will be sworn in as president , and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president , and this country will reclaim its promise , and out of this long political darkness , a brighter day will come .

1	343	"Days after Steven Bannon 's blustery , accusatory interview on "" 60 Minutes , "" in which he warned the apostates blocking President Trump 's agenda that he 's coming after them , Trump confirmed it -- there is no such thing as Trumpism . "
1	343	 In recent weeks he 's assured Democrats he backs legalizing the Dreamers , affirmed a commitment to foreign aid in front of the United Nations , and said he 's adding troops in Afghanistan . 
1	343	" Will Trump now accept "" better "" terms he wants in the Paris climate accord ? "
1	343	 Too bad for Bannon , because none of this is remotely the fault of his favorite punching bags , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan , just Trump himself . 
1	343	" Bannon 's new self - described role as "" wingman "" growling from outside instead of inside the White House -- where as chief strategist he fought openly against the "" globalist "" forces he believed included Trump 's family members -- is n't going very well . "
1	343	 Trump keeps screwing things up for the Breitbart News commander . 
1	343	" After getting fired last month he lamented to the Weekly Standard that "" the Trump presidency that we fought for , and won , is over . "" "
1	343	 But upon reflection , Bannon realized that lame duck talk diminishes his own power , so he 's in overdrive fighting for scraps of a policy vision the president embraces spasmodically . 
1	343	" Bannon says he 's enjoying having "" my hands back on my weapons , "" but he 's outside looking in at a West Wing filled with elites from Goldman Sachs -- the very definition of "" the swamp "" that Bannon is always frothing about . "
1	343	 There , a president is spending political donations on legal fees while his staffers go deep in debt with mounting lawyer bills , visitor logs are kept secret so voters have no idea who is permitted into the Oval Office to influence the president , and a kleptocracy thrives where Trump and his children continue to be enriched by business connected to foreign governments , including the Chinese . 
1	343	 Cabinet secretaries are using government planes for private use and private planes for government work -- violations that would have sparked endless Breitbart bonfires under President Obama . 
1	343	 In reality , however , there was little left of Trumpism to trumpet even before Bannon was fired . 
1	343	 He 's got the travel ban ( or at least a modified version of it ) , and maybe the promised withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement ; Bannon will claim credit if Trump pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal -- but that 's about it . 
1	343	" On trade and immigration , the president has retreated from Bannon 's barricade - crashing proposals and has not withdrawn from NAFTA , not imposed tariffs on Chinese steel imports , has three times backed off threats over funding for a border wall and now come out in favor of what Bannon calls "" amnesty . "" "
1	343	 Yet Bannon has declared war , promising to take out incumbent Republican senators who are n't sufficiently loyal to the president . 
1	343	 Targets are guilty of insufficient fealty to Trump himself , not to an agenda once thought of as Trumpism . 
1	343	 With the backing of loyal mega - donor Robert Mercer , the Bannon forces are targeting Sen. Jeff Flake , and potentially Sens . 
1	343	 Bob Corker and Roger Wicker as well . 
1	343	 GOP leaders are incensed over the millions more they will spend protecting those lawmakers , money that could be spent trying to knock off Democrats . 
1	343	 Currently Bannon is working to elect Roy Moore to replace sitting Sen. Luther Strange in the Alabama Senate race . 
1	343	 Trump has endorsed Strange , also backed by McConnell . 
1	343	 Bannon is backing the more Trumpian candidate and , well , Trump is not . 
1	343	 Bannon , ironically , purports to be interested in protecting GOP majorities in Congress . 
1	343	" Before he could imagine Trump giving away the store on DACA to Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer , Bannon declared in his "" 60 Minutes "" interview that preserving President Obama 's executive order would cause a GOP civil war . "
1	343	" He expects Dreamers to run out their permits and "" self - deport , "" because "" amnesty is non - negotiable . "" "
1	343	" He also said , "" I 'm worried about losing the House now because of this , "" adding that his fear is "" in February and March it will be a civil war inside the Republican Party . "" "
1	343	 But if civil war in the GOP is n't Bannon 's aim , it 's hard to know what is . 
1	343	" He blames everything on Ryan and McConnell . "" "
1	343	 They do not want Donald Trump 's populist economic agenda to be implemented . 
1	343	 It 's very obvious . 
1	343	" It 's obvious as night follows day , "" he told Charlie Rose . "
1	343	 In the name of Trumpism , Bannon swallows heavy doses of denial . 
1	343	 After all , when Trump threatened to withdraw from NAFTA , the president 's kids and other aides made calls to the Canadian government and arranged for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to call Trump and talk him off the ledge . 
1	343	 It was n't Ryan or McConnell . 
1	343	" Trump 's approval ratings remain low , Bannon said , "" because he has n't -- we have n't gotten the wall built . "" "
1	343	 Earth to Steve : Trump has signaled to Congress the wall is a joke . 
1	343	" In the wake of the DACA debacle , Breitbart called the president "" Amnesty Don , "" yet Bannon himself has stayed sheepishly silent . "
1	343	" Ann Coulter , author of "" In Trump We Trust , "" tweeted : "" Looks like Bannon got it wrong . "
1	343	" That shadowy force trying to nullify the 2016 election ... is @realDonaldTrump . "" "
1	343	" Rep. Steve King told the Associated Press the president was destroying his support by betraying his campaign promise , and that his base is "" irreparable , disillusioned beyond repair . "" "
1	343	" King added , "" No promise is credible . "" "
1	343	" Sam Nunberg , a close Bannonite , conceded : "" The reality is sinking in that the Trump administration is on the precipice of turning into an establishment presidency . "" "
1	343	 But Bannon is n't just breaking plates at Breitbart , he 's building his own brand . 
1	343	 Last week , like any other dime - a - dozen elitist , Bannon attended an investor conference in Hong Kong . 
1	343	 He told the exclusive gathering he speaks to Trump every two - to - three days , despite White House denials that the president has spoken more than once with Bannon since he left . 
1	343	" Before Trump disappointed him on DACA , Nunberg had hailed Bannon 's increased influence with Trump . "" "
1	343	 I think Steve leaves and a week later he [ Trump ] pardons Arpaio and they suspend DACA . 
1	343	" I do n't think there was any coincidence there , "" Nunberg told BuzzFeed . "
1	343	" Bannon remains fixated on the threat China poses to the United States , has grimly predicted we will be at war with that nation within five - to-10 years over its buildup of military installations in the South China Sea , and said we 're already "" at economic war "" with China . "
1	343	 Yet his domestic bark in this regard does n't seem to be the same as his overseas - investor - conference bite . 
1	343	" Once there , the New York Times described Bannon as "" more subdued about the purported Chinese threat . "" "
1	343	" The Wall Street Journal reported he described Trump 's great respect for President Xi and prospects for trade , but that "" the U.S. needs to play a stronger role in changing the system in China , an attendee recalled . "" "
1	343	 It 's a far cry from a trade war on steel . 
1	343	 Perhaps over time , Bannonism will go the way of Trumpism .

0	344	 Police ordered it ' ' locked down '' and immediately cell phones lit up with texts and emails between parents , students , and administrators . 
0	344	 There was confusion and near panic among some over reports that there was an active shooter on campus , which there was not . 
0	344	 Why ? 
0	344	 Well , it appears that the shooting happened adjacent to a shopping center called ' Marina Village ' . 
0	344	" On campus there 's an area referred to as ' ' The Village "" , so reports of a shooting in ' ' The Village "" or at "" The Village '' led to understandable confusion . "
0	344	 Yet one of the benefits of social media and that fact that every student has a cell phone , is that the accurate story got out there quickly and students and parents worst fears were calmed within minutes .

0	345	" ( CNSNews.com ) - Continuing a series of tweets on lax border security Wednesday , President Donald Trump promised quick action : "" We will be taking strong action today , "" he promised , without getting specific . "
0	345	" His full tweet , coming shortly after 7 a.m. , read : "" Our Border Laws are very weak while those of Mexico & Canada are very strong . "
0	345	 Congress must change these Obama era , and other , laws NOW ! 
0	345	 The Democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked .... CRIME ! 
0	345	" We will be taking strong action today . "" "
0	345	 On Tuesday , Trump said he plans to send the U.S. military to guard the border with Mexico : 
0	345	" "" We have very bad laws for our border , and we are going to be doing some things — I 've been speaking with General Mattis — we 're going to be doing things militarily , "" said Trump at a White House meeting with leaders of the Baltic nations . "
0	345	" "" Until we can have a wall and proper security , we 're going to be guarding our border with the military , "" he said . "" "
0	345	 That 's a big step . 
0	345	" We really have n't done that before , or certainly not very much before . "" "
0	345	 Since Easter Sunday , when Fox News and The Drudge Report featured news about a caravan of Central Americans making their way to the United States through Mexico , Trump has issued a dozen tweets on border security . 
0	345	 On April 3 , he tweeted : 
0	345	" The big Caravan of People from Honduras , now coming across Mexico and heading to our "" Weak Laws "" Border , had better be stopped before it gets there . "
0	345	 Cash cow NAFTA is in play , as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen . 
0	345	 Congress MUST ACT NOW ! 
0	345	 WE WILL PROTECT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER ! 
0	345	 On April 2 : 
0	345	 As ridiculous as it sounds , the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from . 
0	345	 A whole big wasted procedure must take place . 
0	345	 Mexico & Canada have tough immigration laws , whereas ours are an Obama joke . 
0	345	 ACT CONGRESS 
0	345	 Honduras , Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to , sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES . 
0	345	 Caravans are heading here . 
0	345	 Must pass tough laws and build the WALL . 
0	345	 Democrats allow open borders , drugs and crime ! 
0	345	 DACA is dead because the Democrats did n't care or act , and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon ... No longer works . 
0	345	 Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation . 
0	345	 Democrats want No Borders , hence drugs and crime ! 
0	345	 Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA ... They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic . 
0	345	 With all of the money they make from the U.S. , hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours , at least until Congress changes our immigration laws ! 
0	345	" Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large "" Caravans "" of people enter their country . "
0	345	 They must stop them at their Northern Border , which they can do because their border laws work , not allow them to pass through into our country , which has no effective border laws . 
0	345	 Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation , use Nuclear Option if necessary , to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People . 
0	345	 Border Patrol Agents ( and ICE ) are GREAT , but the weak Dem laws do n't allow them to do their job . 
0	345	 Act now Congress , our country is being stolen ! 
0	345	 On April 1 : 
0	345	 Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal ( Democrat ) laws like Catch & Release . 
0	345	" Getting more dangerous . "" "
0	345	" Caravans "" coming . "
0	345	 Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW . 
0	345	 NO MORE DACA DEAL ! 
0	345	 Mexico is doing very little , if not NOTHING , at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border , and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws . 
0	345	 They must stop the big drug and people flows , or I will stop their cash cow , NAFTA . 
0	345	 NEED WALL !

1	346	The slaughter that happened last Sunday evening in Las Vegas , when an American man shot randomly into a crowd of around 22,000 at a music festival , was the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history . 
1	346	 It also continued a pattern of terrorist attacks : all terrorists who have carried out lethal attacks in the U.S. since 9/11 have been citizens or permanent residents . 
1	346	" In Trump 's first speech to Congress , he claimed "" the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism - related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country . "" "
1	346	" That is a flat - out lie that earned Trump "" four Pinocchios "" — the most dishonest rating given by fact checkers at Washington Post . "
1	346	 Here 's the truth : 154 people have been murdered by terrorists on U.S. soil since September 11 , 2001 ; according to the New America Foundation , all of these murderers were U.S. citizens or legal residents . 
1	346	 This means of course that none of these terrorists came from the countries listed in Trump 's travel ban , even though the United States is supposedly a safer place thanks to the travel ban . 
1	346	" In fact , as New America points out : "" None of the deadly attackers since 9/11 emigrated or came from a family that emigrated from one of these countries nor were any of the 9/11 attackers from the listed countries . "
1	346	" Eight of the lethal attackers were born American citizens . "" "
1	346	 This is not to deny that there have been deadly attacks since 9/11 that have been inspired by jihadism and foreign terror groups . 
1	346	 The deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history prior to the Las Vegas killings took place in June 2016 , when Omar Mateen , an ISIS - inspired terrorist who was an American - born citizen of Afghan descent , opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando , Florida , murdering 49 people and injuring another 53 . 
1	346	 Nor can we ignore the vicious attacks carried out by ISIS militants that have killed or injured hundreds of people in England , France and Canada . 
1	346	 Just this week two women were killed in a stabbing attack in Marseille , France , by a man allegedly promoting Islamic extremism . 
1	346	 In the U.S. however , more terrorist attacks have been carried out by white American men than jihadists . 
1	346	 Here are a few of those attacks , as highlighted by Vox : 
1	346	 Last Sunday night , October 1 , a 64-year - old white man from Mesquite , Nevada , opened rapid fire on a concert audienceof over 22,000 music lovers in Las Vegas . 
1	346	 So far 59 people are known to have died and over 500 were wounded . 
1	346	" In August , a 20-year - old white supremacist from Ohio plowed his car into a crowd of people protesting the "" Unite the Right "" rally , killing Heather Heyer and injuring at least 19 others . "
1	346	 In May , a 35-year - old white man , Jeremy Joseph Christian from Oregon , screamed anti - Muslim threats at two Muslim teenagers on a train in Portland . 
1	346	 When two men stepped in to protect the young women , he stabbed them both to death and wounded a third man . 
1	346	 In March , a 28-year - old white man traveled from Baltimore to New York City with the goal of murdering black men . 
1	346	 New York authorities charged him with terrorism after he stabbed 66-year - old Timothy Caughman to death . 
1	346	 Reaching back further in time , remember Charleston , South Carolina and Sandy Hook , Connecticut ? 
1	346	 White American males are the primary terrorist threat in the U.S. 
1	346	" While Trump is busy "" keeping American citizens safe "" by denying innocent Muslims the right to enter the U.S. , he is also increasing the number of people the U.S. is guilty of killing worldwide . "
1	346	" In the years since 9/11 , the U.S. has been responsible for thousands of deaths , including 7,000 of its own soldiers , in the "" War on Terror . "" "
1	346	 Americans troops are still fighting and dying in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
1	346	 With the Taliban going strong , Trump recently announced his decision to send more troops to Afghanistan . 
1	346	 The invasion of Iraq by the U.S. helped destabilize the entire region and lead to the creation of ISIS , which has been waging its brutal war in the Middle East since then . 
1	346	 And let 's not forget the American complicity in the destruction of Yemen . 
1	346	 The U.S. has sold billions of dollars worth of deadly weapons to Saudi Arabia , which has used them to attack Yemeni civilians , resulting in the deaths of over 10,000 people . 
1	346	 Far from facing this hypocrisy , Trump is now talking about revising export regulations to make it even easier for American arms manufacturers to sell to international buyers . 
1	346	 Meanwhile Trump has put in place a travel ban on visitors from mainly Muslim - majority countries , who are fleeing from this deadly chaos . 
1	346	 If you agree the Muslim ban is cruel and misguided , please sign this Care2 petition , telling Trump to stand up for American values and abolish the immigration ban .

1	347	Clinton , who has grown increasingly public and vocal in recent weeks , appears ready to drive the bus again . 
1	347	 But do we have to be the passengers ? 
1	347	 By T.A. Frank ; VanityFair : 
1	347	 With Donald Trump busy spreading havoc around the world — most recently tweeting about James Comey 's testimony , or feeding into the crisis over Qatar — it 's reasonable to ask who can be bothered to gripe about Hillary Clinton . 
1	347	 But I can . 
1	347	 One makes the time . 
1	347	 Or maybe one does n't , but in a two - party system there 's only one alternative to the party of Trump , and the role of Clinton in that party is therefore important . 
1	347	 Lately , it has been increasing . 
1	347	 Hillary has been making high - profile public appearances and started talking frankly about her distaste for Trump and her dismay over the people and things that cost her the election . 
1	347	" She has even founded a PAC called Onward Together , a 501(c)(4 ) that will "" advance progressive values . "" "
1	347	 Whether we like it or not , the Clintons are back in the game . 
1	347	 It 's up to the rest of us to figure out if we approve . 
1	347	 Just about everything we do lends itself to a generous or hostile interpretation . 
1	347	 Our friends think we feed the poor because we have genuine compassion , and our enemies think we do so because we want to look good . 
1	347	 The benign take on motives is n't always closest to the truth , but it 's the better bet . ( 
1	347	 On the occasions that I 've had an inside view of something in the glare of the press , those with the darkest take on it have usually been wrong . ) 
1	347	 I 've been tough on Chelsea Clinton — hard not to be — but Hillary Clinton has a much higher accomplishment - to - self - regard ratio . 
1	347	 So why not start generously ?

1	347	 The Clinton Blame Game : Hillary Needs to Accept Responsibility for Loss 
1	347	 No compatible source was found for this video . 
1	347	 By Brian Brinker ; OpsLens : 
1	347	 Now that Hillary Clinton is making her way back into the public spotlight , we 're starting to hear a lot more about who 's to blame for her loss . 
1	347	 Of course , President Trump is at the top of her list . 
1	347	 So too are members of her campaign staff , pollsters , The New York Times , supporters who did n't show up at the polls , James Comey , Putin and the Russians , and various others . 
1	347	 You know whose name you 're not going to find ? 
1	347	 Hillary Clinton 's own . 
1	347	 Save perhaps for President Trump , no one else is singularly so responsible for her loss than Hillary herself . 
1	347	 Yet , she has so far proven unwilling to take any of the blame . 
1	347	" As Hillary stated in a recent interview , "" I take responsibility for every decision I make — but that 's not why I lost . "" "
1	347	 In other words , the blame does n't fall on Hillary 's shoulders , at least in her mind . 
1	347	 However , as the nominee and candidate for president , no one else should have to shoulder as much blame as Hillary . 
1	347	" And I say this as someone who does believe that sexism and other "" unfair "" factors played a role . "
1	347	 Still , it was n't sexism that inspired Hillary to ignore voters in Michigan and Wisconsin and to jet set out to California to meet with rich donors . 
1	347	 And it was n't sexism that inspired a largely negative campaign that focused on why people should vote against Donald Trump , rather than why they should vote for Hillary Clinton . 
1	347	 Turns out that her campaign did n't inspire a lot of people to the polls . 
1	347	 Sexism may have been a factor in Hillary 's inability to connect with voters , especially working and middle class voters . 
1	347	 But there were many other factors as well . 
1	347	 Hillary has a tendency of coming off as an elitist . 
1	347	 She ca n't pour a beer , she has n't driven a car in years , and she always seemed to struggle to relate to people directly . 
1	347	 Her campaign , meanwhile , was mostly tone deaf . 
1	347	 After winning the DNC nomination , she largely blew off Michigan and Wisconsin . 
1	347	 The problem is that if you want midwestern voters , you have to meet with them and respect them . 
1	347	 You ca n't ignore them and skip off to sunny California to eat triple - digit meals and hob knob with celebrities and millionaires instead .

0	349	The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops called out former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon just days after he accused the Catholic Church of having ulterior motives in helping undocumented immigrants . 
0	349	" James Rogers , the USCCB 's chief spokesman , called Bannon 's comments "" preposterous "" in a interview on Sirius Radio . "
0	349	" Rogers was referring to Steve Bannon 's interview with Charlie Rose on "" 60 Minutes "" where he claimed the Catholic Church only needs "" illegal aliens "" as worshipers . "
0	349	 Rogers says Bannon 's statements are untrue .

0	350	At least 58 people are dead and 518 more wounded after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas Sunday night . 
0	350	 The assailant opened fire with a fully automatic weapon just as Jason Aldean was beginning his show at the Route 91 Harvest Festival . 
0	350	 Videos posted on social media show Aldean , one of the biggest names in the genre , singing as very rapid gunfire begins in the background . 
0	350	 He can be seen running from stage as he , and the thousands in the crowd who came to see him , realized the horror of what was happening . 
0	350	 No matter how often these tragedies occur ( and it is far too often ) , one never goes into an event thinking it will happen then or there . 
0	350	 The terror is unimaginable . 
0	350	 In this case , it was also protracted . 
0	350	 A gunman continued to rain bullets on the audience for up to two terrifying hours , reports indicate . 
0	350	 Victims ran to safety , according to NBC News , during momentary breaks in the violence , at which point the shooter presumably reloaded . 
0	350	 Many were trapped in the venue for what must have felt like an eternity , but police SWAT officers eventually found and killed the shooter . 
0	350	 He was found on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Casino , Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said , and shot dead . 
0	350	" "" Right now we believe it 's a solo act , a lone wolf attacker , "" Lombardo told reporters . "" "
0	350	" We are pretty confident there is no longer a threat . "" "
0	350	 The gunman has not yet been identified . 
0	350	 Aldean said he was safe in an Instagram post early Monday , sharing an image of the city and asking for prayers for the victims : 
0	350	" "" Tonight has been beyond horrific . "
0	350	" I still do nt know what to say but wanted to let everyone know that Me and my Crew are safe . "" "
0	350	" "" My Thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved tonight , "" he wrote , clearly as stunned and traumatized as anyone else . "
0	350	" "" It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night . "" "
0	350	" Aldean 's wife Brittany Kerr posted her own message on Instagram , saying , "" We are safe … our angels were definitely watching over us tonight . "" "
0	350	" "" No words for what happened , "" she added . "
0	350	" "" Just horrific . "
0	350	" Praying for everyone . "" "
0	350	 Witness accounts are what you would expect - unable to fully do justice to what happened as you read this , but terrifying nonetheless . 
0	350	 Country star Jake Owen was one of the witnesses , having just finished his set and was still on stage when the shooting started . 
0	350	" "" I was crouched down behind a cop car , "" he said . "
0	350	" "" There was blood on people and you could see a couple of people in the streets that looked like they had been shot , "" Owen added . "
0	350	" Ivetta Saldana told the Las Vegas Review - Journal , "" It was was a horror show . "
0	350	" People were standing around , then they hit the floor . "" "
0	350	" Robyn Webb , who was at the concert along with her husband last night , told the newspaper , "" It just kept coming . "
0	350	" It was relentless . "" "
0	350	 Authorities , meanwhile , are searching for a 62-year - old woman named Marylou Danley , whom they believe is the gunman 's roommate . 
0	350	 Police have searched a home in Mesquite , Nevada , 85 miles from Las Vegas , where it is believed the gunman lived with Danley . 
0	350	 She is considered a person of interest in the case . 
0	350	 UPDATE : Police have identified the assailant as Stephen Paddock , 64 . 
0	350	 He is shown above with his companion , Danley . 
0	350	 Paddock is believed to have begun his attack around 10:00 pm local time and to have continued shooting for two hours . 
0	350	 Police were reportedly able to locate Paddock quickly due to the smoke from his weapon setting off hotel fire detectors . 
0	350	 Paddock 's motives for the shooting remain unclear . 
0	350	 Early reports indicate that he was not a member of any militant group . 
0	350	 He was not known to hold extremist political or religious beliefs , though the investigation into the matter is just hours old . 
0	350	 Danley was apprehended for questioning at 3:40 a.m. 
0	350	 It is not currently known if she 's being treated as an accomplice in the attack , or whether law enforcement simply wants to learn more . 
0	350	 In any case , reports indicate that several guns , including at least eight rifles , were found in the room rented by Paddock and Danley . 
0	350	" "" We have no idea what his belief system was , "" Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said during his press briefing early this morning . "

1	352	" The infamous Access Hollywood tape in which Donald Trump brags about his ability to "" grab "" women with impunity because he 's famous is real , Access Hollywood‘s hosts asserted on Monday — just in case the president had any doubts . "
1	352	" In response to a report that Trump was questioning the authenticity of the 2005 hot - mic recording , which captured the former reality TV star saying he could "" grab [ women ] by the pussy , "" Access Hollywood host Natalie Morales said on Monday 's show that the tap is , in fact , "" very real . "" "
1	352	" "" We wanted to clear something up that has been reported across the media landscape . "
1	352	" Let us make this perfectly clear : The tape is very real , "" Morales said . "" "
1	352	 Remember his excuse at the time was ‘ locker room talk . ' 
1	352	" He said every one of those words . "" "
1	352	" TRUMP : The "" Access Hollywood "" tape might be fake "
1	352	 After the Washington Post revealed the tape ahead of the 2016 presidential election , Trump apologized and at no time stated that the tape was faked . 
1	352	" When CNN 's Anderson Cooper pressed Trump on whether he "" understood "" that what he said was an admission of sexual assault , Trump pushed back , dismissing his comments as "" locker room talk . "" "
1	352	" "" I do n't think you understand what was said , "" Trump responded to Cooper during an October 2016 presidential debate . "" "
1	352	 This was locker room talk . 
1	352	 I 'm not proud of it . 
1	352	 I apologized to my family , I apologized to the American people . 
1	352	" Certainly , I 'm not proud of it , but this was locker room talk . "" "
1	352	 Following publication of the tape , at least 16 women came forward to say Trump sexually harassed or assaulted them .

1	352	 News that Trump reportedly questioned the tape 's veracity — once to a senator and , more recently , once to an adviser , according to the New York Times — brought the tape back to the surface amid an outpouring of allegations against high - profile men across entertainment , politics , and media . 
1	352	 During Monday 's press briefing , White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders refused to address Trump 's reported skepticism of the tape 's legitimacy and characterized the tape as unimportant because Trump won the election . 
1	352	" "" The president addressed this , this was litigated and certainly answered during the election by the overwhelming support for the president and the fact he 's sitting here in the Oval Office today , "" she said .‘ Access Hollywood ' to Trump : The tape is ‘ very real '"

0	358	"Vice President Biden defended Hillary Clinton 's decision to use a private email server as secretary of state in an interview Thursday with "" Face the Nation "" moderator John Dickerson . "
0	358	" Dickerson asked Biden about a lesson from his Grandfather Finnegan : "" Public servants are obliged to level with everybody , whether or not they 'll like what he , the public servant , has to say . "" "
0	358	" He asked the vice president , "" Do you think that applies to Hillary Clinton 's dealing with this private server that she set up ? "" "
0	358	" "" Well , I think it 's a combination of a couple of things , "" Biden replied . "" "
0	358	 One , I do n't think she understood the gravity of setting it up . 
0	358	" She thought it was , ‘ This is okay to do . ' "" "
0	358	 Clinton has said she set up her private server for the sake of convenience , but she has since acknowledged that it was a mistake and that she would use the government system if she had to do it over again . 
0	358	 Biden further suggested that Clinton may be a bit battle - scarred from her long time in the public eye , and he said that may have contributed to her initial clumsy response to the email controversy . 
0	358	" "" This woman has been so battered over 30 years , "" Biden explained . "" "
0	358	" I think then when faced with , ‘ This is a problem , ' I think instead of just cutting it and dealing with it immediately , there 's always an inclination to overthink it . "" "

1	360	 In his Alabama appearance for Roy Moore , Steve Bannon turned in an intellectually and morally putrid performance even by his standards . 
1	360	 There is a partisan case for voting for Moore , which is simply that Republicans ca n't afford to lose a Senate seat over the next three years and Moore 's failings must be ignored or rationalized away for the larger good of the party . 
1	360	 This is not an elevated line of reasoning and is not obviously correct on its own terms . 
1	360	 With Democrats throwing John Conyers and Al Franken overboard , Senate Republicans would be welcoming into their ranks a potent symbol of sexual malfeasance to be used against them in the 2018 midterms . 
1	360	 It 's a better argument , though , than the tawdry justifications offered up by Bannon , who parachuted into an already disreputable campaign and dragged it through the gutter . 
1	360	" Bannon seems to misunderstand the nature of the deplorables he seeks to lead . "" "
1	360	" Deplorable "" is supposed to be an unfair , disparaging term for people who believe reasonable but politically incorrect things ( immigration should be restricted , NFL players should stand during the national anthem , all lives matter , etc . ) . "
1	360	 It should n't be a license for doing truly deplorable things . 
1	360	 Democrats , at least some of them , now want to jettison Bill Clinton and are saying that they were wrong to defend him during his scandals . 
1	360	 For his part , Bannon wants to pick up the ethics of the party of Clinton and transfer them into the GOP . 
1	360	" In Alabama , Bannon used that phrase redolent of the 1990s , "" the politics of personal destruction . "" "
1	360	 Who is doing the destroying ? 
1	360	 Why the globalists , of course . 
1	360	 There is nothing they are n't capable of . 
1	360	 It 's not clear why the globalists would be so fixated on defeating Moore that they 'd work behind the scenes to get a bunch of women — and corroborating witnesses — who do n't know each other to lie about Moore having a romantic interest in them when they were teenagers . 
1	360	 It seems a lot of effort to defeat a man who is arguing he should be elected to provide another vote for corporate tax cuts . 
1	360	" Bannon referred to a conspiracy against Donald Trump in the way the "" Access Hollywood "" tape was brought to light , somewhat jocularly . "
1	360	 But his mind - set is deeply conspiratorial . 
1	360	 Because there are so many forces arrayed against you — the globalists , the establishment , the media — you are freed of any moral responsibility or standards . 
1	360	" In fact , the mere mention of the words "" honor "" or "" integrity "" is a terrible provocation . "
1	360	 Bannon launched his scurrilous attack on Mitt Romney because the former Republican presidential nominee used those terms in opposing Moore . 
1	360	" Bannon shot back , in a truly perverse riff , that Moore has more honor in his "" pinkie "" than the entire Romney clan ; per Bannon , Moore served in Vietnam and Romney did n't , and none of Romney 's sons joined the military . "
1	360	 Obviously , if going to Vietnam and having kids who served in the military is the sole measure of honor , Trump fails the test , and John McCain passes it . 
1	360	 This does n't stop Bannon from considering Trump the great savior of the republic and McCain a disgrace . 
1	360	 But it 's not worth trying too hard to unpack Bannon 's spiel . 
1	360	 There is a huge element of play - acting here . 
1	360	 Bannon waited to see which way the wind was blowing in Alabama . 
1	360	 If Moore were still running consistently behind Democrat Doug Jones , Bannon would n't be holding a campaign rally for him and challenging Romney to come down to Alabama to prove his manhood . 
1	360	 He 'd be looking to minimize the damage and shift the blame ( the advantage of the specter of an all - powerful establishment is that it can be blamed for anything ) . 
1	360	 Privately , Bannon ca n't be thrilled that he 's stuck with Moore , and he must know that Moore is a kook , even if he ca n't admit it in public . 
1	360	 Bannon likes to attack everyone else in the party for lacking courage , but in Alabama , he 's afraid to admit he backed a bum candidate and afraid to acknowledge the truth about Moore . 
1	360	 The urgency to get the party to back Moore - type candidates is n't immediately apparent . 
1	360	 If the point is just to hold Republican Senate seats , safer , more conventional Republicans are better suited to the task . 
1	360	" If the point is just to support the Trump agenda , safer , more conventional candidates are as reliable , and perhaps more reliable than the likes of Moore , who opposed the Graham - Cassidy health care bill ( "" Rand Paul praises Roy Moore for opposing Obamacare repeal effort "" is how one headline put it at the time ) . "
1	360	 Part of the point has to be to elect candidates who have no standards for the sake of it . 
1	360	 Bannon may be thinking ahead to a time when the Trump sex allegations become a live issue again or when a true scandal emerges from the Robert Mueller investigation . 
1	360	 In this scenario , will there be anyone more naturally inclined to be dismissive of the accusers or other evidence than former Judge Roy Moore ? 
1	360	 Bannon may also believe that a GOP with a highly attuned ethical sense ca n't truly be the party of the working class . 
1	360	" In which case , who is the one who has contempt for the "" rubes "" ?The Garbage Case for Roy Moore"

0	362	 — Valerie Plame Wilson ( @ValeriePlame ) August 18 , 2017Former CIA agent wants to buy Twitter to kick Donald Trump off
0	363	"President Donald Trump on Sunday strongly condemned what he described in tweets as a "" mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria "" that allegedly left women and children dead . "
0	363	" He laid the blame squarely at the feet of Russian President Vladimir Putin , Russia and Iran for backing resident Bashar al - Assad , who he called an "" animal . "" "
0	363	" Trump also warned , "" Big price to pay . "" "
0	363	" "" Open area immediately for medical help and verification . "
0	363	 Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever . 
0	363	" SICK ! "" "
0	363	 the president wrote . 
0	363	 In the third of a series of tweets , he faulted former President Barack Obama for not intervening in Syria during his time in office . 
0	363	 In April of last year , Trump ordered a Tomahawk missile strike against a Syrian airbase for a similar chemical attack . 
0	363	 Sunday 's posts left many wondering if Trump would potentially retaliate against the Syrian government , which is backed by Russia . 
0	363	 The criticism of Putin is arguably his strongest critique of Russia since he took office 442 days ago . 
0	363	 Syrian aid groups and activists allege that dozens of people died in a suspected chemical weapons attack on the city of Douma , the last rebel stronghold in eastern Ghouta where Assad has pursued an intensive bombing campaign . 
0	363	" The Syrian American Medical Society said that more than 500 cases , mostly women and children , suffered symptoms "" indicative of exposure to a chemical agent "" and 42 were reported dead . "
0	363	 Both Syria and Russia deny involvement in Sunday 's alleged chemical attack . 
0	363	" Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert said on ABC 's "" This Week "" on Sunday that the White House is considering how to respond . "
0	363	" He added that the national security team had been speaking to the president "" all throughout the evening and the morning . "" "
0	363	" "" I would n't take anything off the table , "" he said . "

0	363	" "" Russia , with its unwavering support for the [ Assad ] regime , ultimately bears responsibility for these brutal attacks , targeting of countless civilians , and the suffocation of Syria 's most vulnerable communities with chemical weapons , "" State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said .

0	363	 Republican and Democrat leaders decried the alleged chemical attack on Sunday , calling for the U.S. to hold the Assad government accountable . 
0	363	 Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , who serves on the Armed Services Committee called on the White House to act . 
0	363	" "" If [ the president ] does n't follow through and live up to that tweet , he 's going to look weak in the eyes of Russia and Iran , "" Graham said on ABC 's "" This Week "" on Sunday . "" "

0	363	 Others from the president 's own party piled on . 
0	363	" Sen. Susan Collins , R - Maine , said on CNN 's "" State of the Union "" that Trump should rethink his plans for an early withdrawal from Syria and consider another targeted attack on Syria 's military facilities , such as the one he ordered a year ago . "
0	363	" "" That may be an option that we should consider now , "" she said . "" "
0	363	" But it is further reason why it is so important that the president ramp up the pressure and the sanctions on the Russian government , because , without the support of Russia , I do not believe that Assad would still be in office . "" "
0	363	 Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz . , 
0	363	 also blasted the president , as he said Trump signaling last week that the U.S. would withdraw from Syria only served to embolden Assad , Russia and Iran to conduct the attack . 
0	363	 While McCain said it was good that Trump criticized all three parties on Twitter , he said social media posts meant little in this situation . 
0	363	" "" The question now is whether he will do anything about it , "" he said . "" "

0	363	 I think we need to deal also with Russia and Iran 's involvement in this . 
0	363	" I think they are complicit . "" "
0	363	 Democrats also called for the White House to act and coordinate an international response .

0	363	" said on CBS 's "" Face the Nation "" that "" President Assad needs to be held accountable for his war crimes . "" "
0	363	" "" We need to make sure that there is a proceeding started by the international community to hold him accountable , "" said Cardin , who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . "" "
0	363	" This is not the first use of chemical weapons . "" "
0	363	 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif . , 
0	363	" said that Putin needed to be held accountable for the alleged attack as he had enabled "" these war crimes . "" "
0	363	 But how to do that rests with the White House , she added . 
0	363	" "" Members of Congress expect a comprehensive intelligence briefing on this attack as soon as possible , "" she said in a statement . "" "

0	365	SEATTLE - Three brothers in their 70s and 80s have been arrested in Seattle for allegedly possessing images of child - sex abuse with police still investigating them , according to Seattle Police Department . 
0	365	 > > Read about the latest in the investigation here 
0	365	 Key developments : 82-year - old Charles Emery , 80-year - old Thomas Emery and 79-year - old Edwin Emery were charged Monday with two counts of possession of depictions of minors engaged in sexual conduct . 
0	365	 Police say a family member was cleaning the men 's Green Lake home and discovered what she believed to be materials depicting the sexual abuse of a child . 
0	365	 Charging papers say authorities including members of the FBI 's internet Crimes Against Children Task Force searched the home , finding evidence prosecutors say that each of the men spent the majority of their lives sexually abusing children and exploiting children depicted in child pornography . 
0	365	" Detectives say it was Charles ' "" manifestos "" about Satanic rituals , kidnapping , raping and killing girls that led them to dig under sheds , searching for evidence of potential murder . "
0	365	 What the investigation first found 
0	365	 On Aug. 19 , Seattle child sex crime detectives say they acted on a tip from a relative who arrived to clean out the garage of the brothers . 
0	365	 The relative called 911 . 
0	365	 At the home , detectives collected a staggering amount of child porn . 
0	365	 They also found evidence of the sexual exploitation of young girls as well as children 's worn clothing and underwear , children 's shoes , toys and movies . 
0	365	 Homeland Security 's Internet Child Exploitation team assisted in the search , which involved digging for potential buried evidence under locked sheds and garages . 
0	365	 About the brothers 
0	365	 Neighbors in the quiet Green Lake neighborhood along Northeast 59th St . 
0	365	 Street say they always wondered about the dilapidated house and the three guarded , mysterious Emery brothers who lived there since 1962 . 
0	365	" "" I 've never seen a girlfriend , a wife , a woman of any type visit that house , "" said Don Smith , who lives next door . "
0	365	 Seattle police say the brothers , ranging in age from 78 to 82 , began molesting their own sister and eventually molested other young relatives for decades . 
0	365	 None of them had ever married , none had their own children or many relationships outside their own siblings . 
0	365	 Police arrested 82-year - old Charles Lee Emery in a Queen Anne nursing home . 
0	365	 Eighty - year - old Thomas Edwin Emery and 78-year - old Edwin Harold Emery were arrested at their home . 
0	365	 Scroll down to read about the manifesto . 
0	365	 RELATED COVERAGE : 
0	365	 Detectives say Charles , Thomas and Edwin sexually molested young relatives for years , and collected pictures and even children 's shoes . 
0	365	" But detectives say it was Charles ' "" manifestos "" about Satanic rituals , kidnapping , raping and killing girls that led them to dig under sheds , searching for evidence of potential murder . "
0	365	 Detectives say one of Charles ' writings was found buried and partially burned -- along with a child 's hat . 
0	365	" "" Their writings express desires to kill children , "" said Capt . "
0	365	 Mike Edwards , who leads SPD 's Internet Crimes Against Children ( ICAC ) task force . 
0	365	 The search extended from the home in the Green Lake neighborhood to another home the brothers owned 90 miles away in Shelton . 
0	365	" "" It 's very clear that these three individuals have an obsession with young female children , they 've had this obsession for most if not all of their lives , and they acted on it , "" said Edwards . "
0	365	 Charging documents indicate SPD detectives questioned Edwin Emery and his relatives about child porn found on his computer in 2013 , but no charges were ever filed . 
0	365	 Now detectives are hoping to identify the children in the photos and they hope to find victims who may have been molested decades ago and never came forward . 
0	365	 Neighbors react to brothers ' charges 
0	365	 Neighbors have been wondering exactly what happened in this home since investigators swarmed the home over the weekend . 
0	365	 The new details Seattle police and court documents revealed leave them stunned . 
0	365	 For decades , neighbors did n't think much about the three brothers who 've lived there for 55 years . 
0	365	" "" I just thought they were harmless weird old guys , "" said Julie Vandenberg , who lives directly across the street . "
0	365	 Neighbors saw the investigators in hazardous materials suits and police bring out box after box of evidence on Friday and Saturday .

0	365	" It is sickening , it 's really sickening , "" Vandenberg said . "" "
0	365	" Something happened to little children here - it sounds like little girls , and that 's horrific . "" "

0	365	 The neighbors say they wish they would 've noticed some sign earlier , about what was going on in the house but they 're just glad the three brothers are n't there to victimize kids any longer . 
0	365	 Neighbor Don Smith said he was surprised the allegations were kept quiet for so long .

0	366	"President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that his administration "" will be taking strong action today "" to address what he complained are especially weak border security protections that must be addressed by Congress and the construction of a border wall . "

0	366	 Trump 's online post , which did not come with further details as to what steps his administration would take , came one day after he announced that he would deploy U.S. troops to guard the southern border with Mexico until his promised border wall is completed . 
0	366	" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said later Tuesday that Trump 's plan would mobilize the National Guard , which his two immediate predecessors had also done along the U.S .- Mexico border , and also press Congress to take steps to close "" loopholes "" in the nation 's immigration laws . "
0	366	 Sanders did not say when or how many troops Trump would mobilize or where they would be deployed . 
0	366	 The president has been especially preoccupied with border security this week , seemingly agitated by a group of migrants , mostly from Honduras , that was making its way north through Mexico , past immigration checkpoints and military bases , en route to the U.S. Trump said Tuesday that that group had been broken up by Mexican authorities , who he said did so only after he demanded they act . 
0	366	 More broadly , Trump has struggled to get traction in Congress for his border security priorities , namely that the border wall he promised during the 2016 campaign would be paid for by Mexico . 
0	366	 Democrats have thus far been largely unwilling to go along with plans for the president 's wall .

1	368	U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton acknowledges the crowd at a campaign rally in Ft . 
1	368	 Lauderdale , Florida , U.S. November 1 , 2016 . 
1	368	 Hillary Clinton 's campaign is refocusing on Donald Trump and turning away from the latest investigation of her emails , reminding voters of all the reasons why she believes Trump is unqualified to be president . 
1	368	 At three Florida rallies Tuesday , CBS News ' Nancy Cordes reports that Clinton ticked through her opponent 's most notorious comments about the opposite sex . 
1	368	" "" I want all the girls in America to know : you are valuable , "" Clinton said at a rally in Fort Lauderdale . "" "
1	368	" Do n't let somebody like this bully tell you otherwise ! "" "
1	368	" To another crowd in Dade City , Florida , she added : "" He calls women ugly , disgusting , nasty , all the time ... He does n't see us as full human beings . "" "
1	368	 For proof of her closing argument , Clinton turned to former Miss Universe Alicia Machado , who Trump publicly shamed in 1997 for gaining a little weight . 
1	368	" "" He said to me , Miss Piggy , Miss Housekeeping , Miss Eating Machine , "" Machado said , joining Clinton in Dade City . "
1	368	 It 's a closing argument aimed not just at female voters but also the men who love them . 
1	368	 The Clinton campaign released a series of ads Tuesday -- all of them with the same message . 
1	368	" "" I would n't feel good as a father voting for somebody like that , "" one man says in an ad . "
1	368	 In Columbus , Ohio , President Obama warned that Trump is unlikely to change . 
1	368	" "" If you disrespected women before you were elected , you will disrespect women once you 're president , "" he said . "
1	368	 But in Fort Lauderdale , a protester interrupted Clinton with a sign that said her husband , former President Bill Clinton , is a rapist -- a common sight at Clinton rallies that set her off last night . 
1	368	" "" I am sick and tired of the negative , dark , divisive , dangerous divisions and behaviors of people who support Donald Trump , "" Clinton said . "
1	368	 Aides to the Democratic nominee insist the race is not as tight as new polls suggest . 
1	368	 And yet they 've begun airing ads in four states that supposedly tilt their way : Michigan , Virginia , Colorado , and New Mexico . 
1	368	 The campaign says that is not a sign of nervousness -- it 's a sign that they still have a startling $ 150 million in the bank so why not put it to good use , especially if it helps Democrats down the ballot . 
1	368	 But that does n't explain why Clinton has added a stop in one of those states -- Michigan -- to an already packed schedule .To distract from email controversy , Clinton targets Trump 's record with women
1	369	A wave of liberal rage has marked the last 11 months since the rise and subsequent election of President Donald Trump . 
1	369	 Antifa protestors clad in black masks shut down college campuses , destroy property and indiscriminately attack those they disagree with , whether women or the elderly . 
1	369	 Meanwhile , CNN fires Kathy Griffin for taking photos with a bloody replica of the president 's decapitated head . 
1	369	" Amid this backdrop , The Huffington Post publishes an article calling for the execution of Trump and "" everyone assisting his agenda . "" "
1	369	 Then , shots ring out as a man gorged on media hysteria attempts to slaughter Republican congressmen while they practice for a charity baseball game . 
1	369	 The aggression since Trump 's nomination is difficult to enumerate , but nevertheless , The Daily Caller News Foundation pored over media reports to compile a close but non - exhaustive list of violent acts against conservatives in months following the Republican National Convention . 
1	369	 No compatible source was found for this video . 
1	369	 In creating the list , The DCNF reviewed numerous articles detailing attacks and violent threats against conservatives and Trump supporters . 
1	369	 While there are examples of anonymous threats , The DCNF chose to include only those that resulted in the cancelling of events and two to members of Congress deemed credible . 
1	369	 Some instances of violence between rival protestors were not included as it was difficult to ascertain who initiated the event . 
1	369	 To see the list of attacks visit The Daily Caller . 
1	369	 By now , you already know that Republican lawmakers were the target of a brutal and unjustifiable shooting in Virginia . 
1	369	 House majority whip Steve Scalise was shot several times and has been hospitalized . 
1	369	 He appears to be in critical but stable condition . 
1	369	 Several other Republican lawmakers witnessed the carnage . 
1	369	" The shooter , "" socialist democrat "" James Hodgkinson , was n't so lucky , succumbing to wounds received in a shootout with police officers . "
1	369	 This shooting is a harsh reminder of the growing vitriol in American politics where violence between liberal and conservative hard - liners is only becoming more common , with both sides committing inexcusable violence . 
1	369	 The shooting occurred during an early morning baseball practice . 
1	369	 The shooter , Hodgkinson , appears to have been an ardent Bernie Sanders supporter and opposed President Trump . 
1	369	 His choice of targets was almost certainly not random and was likely premeditated . 
1	369	 Hodgkinson is from Illinois but has been staying in the DC area for at least six weeks . 
1	369	 Besides Scalise , two police officers were wounded during the shooting . 
1	369	 Senator Paul Rand , who witness the event , has hailed the police officers and credited them for preventing a far worse tragedy . 
1	369	 The police officers present were there to guard Scalise . 
1	369	 Hodgkinson already had a track record with the police before the shooting . 
1	369	 He had previously been charged with assault and battery for punching a woman in the face with a closed fist . 
1	369	 He also confronted that woman 's boyfriend with a shotgun , reportedly firing one shot in the air . 
1	369	 Apparently , he also physically abused his daughter , and police were called when he started shooting several pine trees on his property . 
1	369	 Neighbors were worried that bullets would strike nearby homes . 
1	369	" Hodgkinson also claimed to be a "" democratic socialist "" on his social media profiles . "
1	369	" Writing to the Belleville News - Democrat , he stated , "" I do n't ever again want to hear how great a president [ Ronald Reagan ] was . "
1	369	" All he did was give tax breaks to the rich and put the rest of the country ( or at least 13.1 percent ) out of work . "" "
1	369	" He added , "" To think the Republican Party can call this man their idol is un - American . "

0	370	 Alt - Left refers to a loosely defined term to describe left - wing principles , organizations , politicians and activists , encompassing almost everything outside the norm of mainstream democratic liberal politics . 
0	370	 Used as both a pejorative and an affirmative , alike , alt - left has been used as a catchall term for far - left political ideologies such as socialism , anarchism , communism as well as Antifa groups . 
0	370	" However , because this term remains so undefined and widely denounced amongst the groups associated with it , many of the ideologies within the so - call "" alt - left "" contradict from group to group . "
0	370	 Most groups refuse to give the term creedance , and after U.S. President Donald Trump used the term in a 2017 press conference , many have stated that it is a meaningless phrase .

1	372	 ( Natural News ) A stunning new science paper authored by climate change alarmists and published in the science journal Nature Geoscience has just broken the back of the climate change hoax . 
1	372	" The paper , authored by Myles R. Allen , Richard J. Millar and others , reveals that global warming climate models are flat wrong , having been deceptively biased toward "" worst case "" warming predictions that now turn out to be paranoid scare mongering . "
1	372	" The paper , entitled , "" Emission budgets and pathways consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 ° C , "" concludes that the global warming long feared and hyped by everyone from Al Gore to CNN talking heads was based on faulty software models that do n't stand up to actual measured temperatures in the real world . "
1	372	" In technical jargon , the paper explains , "" We show that limiting cumulative post-2015 CO2 emissions to about 200 GtC would limit post-2015 warming to less than 0.6 ° C in 66 % of Earth system model members . "" "
1	372	 In effect , the current global warming software models used by the IPCC and cited by the media wildly over - estimate the warming effects of CO2 emissions . 
1	372	 How much do they over - estimate warming ? 
1	372	 By about 50 % . 
1	372	 Where the software models predicted a 1.3 C rise in average global temperatures , only a rise of about 0.9 C has actually been recorded ( and many data points in that average have , of course , been fabricated by climate change scientists to push a political narrative ) . 
1	372	 In other words , carbon dioxide emissions do n't produce the warming effects that have been blindly claimed by climate change alarmists . 
1	372	" "" Climate change poses less of an immediate threat to the planet than previously thought because scientists got their modelling wrong , "" reports the UK Telegraph . "" "
1	372	" New research by British scientists reveals the world is being polluted and warming up less quickly than 10-year - old forecasts predicted , giving countries more time to get a grip on their carbon output . "" "
1	372	 In other words , the climate change threat has been wildly overstated . 
1	372	" The fear mongering of Al Gore and the government - funded science community can truly only be described as a "" junk science hoax . "" "
1	372	 Climate alarmists suddenly find themselves admitting they were wrong all along 
1	372	" "" The paper … concedes that it is now almost impossible that the doomsday predictions made in the last IPCC Assessment Report of 1.5 degrees C warming above pre - industrial levels by 2022 will come true , "" writes James Delingpole . "
1	372	 He goes on to say : 
1	372	" One researcher - from the alarmist side of the argument , not the skeptical one - has described the paper 's conclusion as "" breathtaking "" in its implications . "
1	372	 He 's right . 
1	372	 The scientists who 've written this paper are n't climate skeptics . 
1	372	 They 're longstanding warmists , implacable foes of climate skeptics , and they 're also actually the people responsible for producing the IPCC 's carbon budget . 
1	372	 Why Doctors In The Know No Longer Prescribe Blood Pressure Meds 
1	372	 In other words , this represents the most massive climbdown from the alarmist camp . 
1	372	 Are we about to see climate change alarmists owning up to the fact that real - world data show their software models to be rooted in junk science ? 
1	372	 The unraveling has begun , but there is so much political capital already invested in the false climate change narrative that it will take years to fully expose the depth of scientific fraud and political dishonesty underpinning the global warming hoax . 
1	372	 Climate change software models were deliberately tweaked to paint an exaggerated doomsday picture in order to scare the world into compliance panic 
1	372	" What 's clear from all this is that IPCC software models were deliberately biased in favor of the worst - case "" doomsday "" predictions in order to terrorize the world with a fake climate change hoax . "
1	372	 But now the fake science is catching up to them , and they 're getting caught in their own lies . 
1	372	" The software models , by the way , were fraudulently programmed with dishonest model "" weights "" to produce alarming warming predictions no matter what temperature data points were entered into the system . "
1	372	 This is best explained in this Natural News article which goes into great detail , covering the IPCC global warming software modeling hoax : 
1	372	 Hacking the IPCC global warming data 
1	372	" The same left - wing media outlets that fabricated the "" Russian hacking "" conspiracy , curiously , have remained totally silent about a real , legitimate hacking that took place almost two decades earlier . "
1	372	" The IPCC "" global warming "" software models , we now know , were "" hacked "" from the very beginning , programmed to falsely produce "" hockey stick "" visuals from almost any data set … include "" random noise "" data . "
1	372	 What follows are selected paragraphs from a fascinating book that investigated this vast political and scientific fraud : The Real Global Warming Disaster by Christopher Booker(Continuum , 2009 ) . 
1	372	 This book is also available as an audio book from Audible.com , so if you enjoy audio books , download a copy there . 
1	372	" Here 's what Booker found when he investigated the "" hacking "" of the temperature data computer models : "
1	372	" From "" The Real Global Warming Disaster "" by Christopher Booker : ( bold emphasis added ) "
1	372	 Nothing alerted us more to the curious nature of the global warming scare than the peculiar tactics used by the IPCC to promote its orthodoxy , brooking no dissent . 
1	372	 More than once in its series of mammoth reports , the IPCC had been caught out in very serious attempts to rewrite the scientific evidence . 
1	372	 The most notorious instance of this was the extraordinary prominence it gave in 2001 to the so - called ‘ hockey stick ' graph , mysteriously produced by a relatively unknown young US scientist , which completely redrew the accepted historical record by purporting to show temperatures in the late twentieth century having shot upwards to a level far higher than had ever been known before . 
1	372	 Although the ‘ hockey stick ' was instantly made the central icon of the IPCC 's cause , it was within a few years to become one of the most comprehensively discredited artefacts in the history of science . 
1	372	 Similarly called into serious doubt was the reliability of some of the other temperature figures on which the IPCC based its case . 
1	372	 Most notably these included those provided by NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) , run by Dr James Hansen , A1 Gore 's closest scientific ally , which were one of the four official sources of temperature data on which the IPCC relied . 
1	372	 These were shown to have been repeatedly ‘ adjusted ' , to suggest that temperatures had risen further and more steeply than was indicated by any of the other three main data - sources . 
1	372	 … Out of the blue in 1998 Britain 's leading science journal Nature , long supportive of the warming orthodoxy , published a new paper on global temperature changes over the previous 600 years , back to 1400 . 
1	372	 Its chief author was Michael Mann , a young physicist - turned - climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts , who had only completed his PhD two years before . 
1	372	 In 1999 he and his colleagues published a further paper , based only on North America but extending their original findings over 1000 years . 
1	372	 Their computer model had enabled them to produce a new temperature graph quite unlike anything seen before . 
1	372	 Instead of the previously familiar rises and falls , this showed the trend of average temperatures having gently declined through nine centuries , but then suddenly shooting up in the twentieth century to a level that was quite unprecedented . 
1	372	 In Mann 's graph such familiar features as the Mediaeval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age had simply vanished . 
1	372	 All those awkward anomalies were shown as having been illusory . 
1	372	 The only real anomaly which emerged from their studies was that sudden exponential rise appearing in the twentieth century , culminating in the ‘ warmest year of the millennium ' , 1998 . 
1	372	 As would eventually emerge , there were several very odd features about Mann 's new graph , soon to be known as the ‘ hockey stick ' because its shape , a long flattish line curving up sharply at the end , was reminiscent of the stick used in ice hockey . 
1	372	 But initially none might have seemed odder than the speed with which this obscure study by a comparatively unknown young scientist came to be taken up as the new ‘ orthodoxy ' . 
1	372	 So radically did the ‘ hockey stick ' rewrite all the accepted versions of climate history that initially it carried all before it , leaving knowledgeable experts stunned . 
1	372	 It was not yet clear quite how Mann had arrived at his remarkable conclusions , precisely what data he had used or what methods the IPCC had used to verify his findings . 
1	372	 The sensational new graph which the IPCC made the centrepiece of its report had been sprung on the world out of left field . 
1	372	 … Yet when , over the years that followed , a number of experts from different fields began to subject Mann 's two papers to careful analysis , some rather serious questions came to be asked about the basis for his study . 
1	372	 For a start , although Mann and his colleagues had cited other evidence for their computer modelling of historical temperatures , it became apparent that they had leaned particularly heavily on ‘ proxy data ' provided by a study five years earlier of tree - rings in ancient bristlecone pine trees growing on the slopes of California 's Sierra Nevada mountains . ‘ 
1	372	 Proxies ' used to calculate temperature consist of data other than direct measurement , such as tree rings , stalactites , ice cores or lake sediments . 
1	372	 According to the 1993 paper used by Mann , these bristlecone pines had shown significantly accelerated growth in the years after 1900 . 
1	372	 But the purpose of this original study had not been to research into past temperatures . 
1	372	 As was made clear by its title - ‘ Detecting the aerial fertilisation effect of atmospheric C02 enrichment in tree - ring chronologies ' - it had been to measure the effect on the trees ' growth rate of the twentieth - century increase in C02 levels . 
1	372	 Tree rings are a notoriously unreliable reflector of temperature changes , because they are chiefly formed during only one short period of the year , and can not therefore give a full picture . 
1	372	 This 1993 study of one group of trees in one untypical corner of the US seemed a remarkably flimsy basis on which to base an estimate of global temperatures going back 1000 years . 
1	372	 Then it transpired that , in order to show the twentieth - century section of the graph , the terrifying upward flick of temperatures at the end of the ‘ hockey stick ' , spliced in with the tree - ring data had been a set of twentieth - century temperature readings , as recorded by more than 2,000 weather stations across the earth 's surface . 
1	372	 It was these which more than anything helped to confirm the most dramatic conclusion of the study , that temperatures in the closing decades of the twentieth century had been shooting up to levels unprecedented in the history of the last 1,000 years , culminating in the ‘ warmest year of the millennium ' , 1998 . 
1	372	 Not only was it far from clear that , for this all - important part of the graph , two quite different sets of data had been used . 
1	372	 Also accepted without qualification was the accuracy of these twentieth - century surface temperature readings . 
1	372	 But the picture given by these was already being questioned by many expert scientists who pointed to evidence that readings from surface weather stations could become seriously distorted by what was known as the ‘ urban heat island effect ' . 
1	372	 The majority of the thermometers in such stations were in the proximity of large and increasingly built - up population centres . 
1	372	 It was well - established that these heated up the atmosphere around them to a significantly higher level than in more isolated locations . 
1	372	 Nowhere was this better illustrated than by contrasting the temperature readings taken on the earth 's surface with those which , since 1979 , had been taken by NASA satellites and weather balloons , using a method developed by Dr Roy Spencer , responsible for climate studies at NASA 's Marshall Space Centre , and Dr John Christie of the University of Alabama , Huntsville . 
1	372	 Surprisingly , these atmospheric measurements showed that , far from warming in the last two decades of the twentieth century , global temperatures had in fact slightly cooled . 
1	372	 As Spencer was at pains to point out , these avoided the distortions created in surface readings by the urban heat island effect . 
1	372	 The reluctance of the IPCC to take proper account of this , he observed , confirmed the suspicion of ‘ many scientists involved in the process ' that the IPCC 's stance on global warming was ‘ guided more by policymakers and politicians than by scientists ' . 
1	372	 What was also remarkable about the ‘ hockey stick ' , as was again widely observed , was how it contradicted all that mass of evidence which supported the generally accepted picture of temperature fluctuations in past centuries . 
1	372	 As was pointed out , tree - rings are not the most reliable guide to assessing past temperatures . 
1	372	 Scores of more direct sources of proxy evidence had been studied over the years , from Africa , South America , Australia , Pakistan , Antarctica , every continent and ocean of the world . 
1	372	 Whether evidence was taken from lake sediments or ice cores , glaciers in the Andes or boreholes in every continent ( Huang et ai , 1997 ) , the results had been remarkably consistent in confirming that the familiar view was right . 
1	372	 There had been a Little Ice Age , across the world . 
1	372	 There had similarly been a Mediaeval Warm Period . 
1	372	 Furthermore , a mass of data confirmed that the world had been even warmer in the Middle Ages than it was in 1998 . 
1	372	 The first comprehensive study to review this point was published in January 2003 by Dr Willie Soon and his colleague Dr Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics . 
1	372	 They had examined 140 expert studies of the climate history of the past 1,000 years , based on every kind of data . 
1	372	 Some had given their findings only in a local or regional context , others had attempted to give a worldwide picture . 
1	372	 But between them these studies had covered every continent . 
1	372	 The question the two researchers had asked of every study was whether or not it showed a ‘ discernible climate anomaly ' at the time of ( 1 ) the Little Ice Age and ( 2 ) the Mediaeval Warm Period ; and ( 3 ) whether it had shown the twentieth century to be the warmest time in the Millennium . 
1	372	 Their conclusion was unequivocal . 
1	372	 Only two of the studies they looked at had not found evidence for the Little Ice Age . 
1	372	 Only seven of the 140 studies had denied the existence of a Mediaeval Warm Period , while 116 had confirmed it . 
1	372	 On the crucial question of whether or not the twentieth century had been the warmest of the past thousand years , only 15 studies , including that of Mann himself , had unambiguously agreed that it was . 
1	372	 The vast majority accepted that earlier centuries had been warmer . 
1	372	 The conclusion of Soon and Baliunas was that ‘ Across the world , many records reveal that the twentieth century is probably not the warmest nor a uniquely extreme climatic period of the last millennium . ' 
1	372	 But if Mann and his colleagues had got the picture as wrong as this survey of the literature suggested , nothing did more to expose just how this might have come about than a remarkable feat of analysis carried out later in the same year by two Canadians and published in October 2003 . (

1	372	 Stephen McIntyre , who began their study , was a financial consultant and statistical analyst specialising in the minerals industry , and was later joined by Ross McKitrick , a professor of economics at Guelph University . 
1	372	 Neither made any pretensions to being a climate scientist , but where they did have considerable expertise was in knowing how computers could be used to play around with statistics . 
1	372	 They were also wearily familiar with people using hockey sticklike curves , showing an exaggerated upward rise at the end , to sell a business prospect or to ‘ prove ' some tendentious point . 
1	372	 Intrigued by the shape of the IPCC 's now famous ‘ hockey stick ' graph , in the spring of 2003 McIntyre approached Mann and his colleagues to ask for a look at their original data set . ‘ 
1	372	 After some delay ' , Mann ‘ arranged provision of a file which was represented as the one used ' for his paper . 
1	372	 But it turned out not to include ‘ most of the computer code used to produce their results ' . 
1	372	 This suggested to McIntyre , who was joined later that summer by McKitrick , that no one else had previously asked to examine it , as should have been required both by peer - reviewers for the paper published in Nature and , above all , by the IPCC itself . ( 
1	372	" This account of the ‘ hockey stick ' saga is based on several sources , in particular Ross McKitrick 's paper already cited , ‘ What is the "" hockey stick "" debate about ? ' ( "
1	372	 2005 ) , and his evidence to the House of Lords Committee on Economic Affairs , ‘ The Economics of Climate Change ' , Vol . 
1	372	 II , Evidence , 2005 . 
1	372	" See also David Holland , ‘ Bias and concealment in the IPCC Process : the "" Hockey Stick "" affair and its implications ' ( 2007 ) , op . "
1	372	 cit . ) 
1	372	 When McIntyre fed the data into his own computer , he found that it did not produce the claimed results . 
1	372	 At the heart of the problem was what is known as ‘ principal component analysis ' , a technique used by computer analysts to handle a large mass of data by averaging out its components , weighting them by their relative significance . 
1	372	 One of the first things McIntyre had discovered was that the ‘ principal component analysis ' used by Mann could not be replicated . ‘ 
1	372	 In the process of looking up all the data sources and rebuilding Mann 's data set from scratch ' , he discovered ‘ quite a few errors concerning location labels , use of obsolete editions , unexplained truncations of various series etc . ' ( 
1	372	 for instance , data reported to be from Boston , Mass. , turned out to be from Paris , France , Central England temperature data had been truncated to leave out its coldest period , and so forth ) . 
1	372	 But the real problem lay with the ‘ principal component analysis ' itself . 
1	372	 It turned out that an algorithm had been programmed into Mann 's computer model which ‘ mined ' for hockey stick shapes whatever data was fed into it . 
1	372	 As McKitrick was later to explain , ‘ had the IPCC actually done the kind of rigorous review that they boast of they would have discovered that there was an error in a routine calculation step ( principal component analysis ) that falsely identified a hockey stick shape as the dominant pattern in the data . 
1	372	 The flawed computer program can even pull out spurious hockey stick shapes from lists of trendless random numbers . ' ( 
1	372	 McKitrick , House of Lords evidence , op . 
1	372	 cit . ) 
1	372	 Using Mann 's algorithm , the two men fed a pile of random and meaningless data ( ‘ red noise ' ) into the computer 10,000 times . 
1	372	 More than 99 per cent of the time the graph which emerged bore a ‘ hockey stick ' shape . 
1	372	 They found that their replication of Mann 's method failed ‘ all basic tests of statistical significance ' . 
1	372	 When they ran the programme again properly , however , keeping the rest of Mann 's data but removing the bristlecone pine figures on which he had so heavily relied , they found that the Mediaeval Warming once again unmistakably emerged . 
1	372	 Indeed their ‘ major finding ' , according to McKitrick , was that Mann 's own data confirmed that the warming in the fifteenth century exceeded anything in the twentieth century.44 
1	372	 One example of how this worked they later quoted was based on comparing two sets of data used by Mann for his second 1999 paper , confined to proxy data from North America . 
1	372	 One was drawn from bristlecone pines in western North America , the other from a tree ring chronology in Arkansas . 
1	372	 In their raw state , the Californian series showed a ‘ hockey stick ' shape ; the other , typical of most North American tree ring series , showed an irregular but basically flat line with no final upward spurt . 
1	372	 When these were put together , however , the algorithm emphasised the twentieth - century rise by giving ‘ 390 times as much weight ' to the bristlecone pines as to the trees from Arkansas.45 
1	372	 In other words , although Mann had used hundreds of tree ring proxies from all over North America , most showing a flattish line like that from Arkansas , the PCAs used to determine their relative significance had given enormously greater weight to those Californian bristlecones with their anomalous ‘ hockey stick ' pattern . 
1	372	 Furthermore , McIntyre and McKitrick found that Mann had been well aware that by removing the bristlecone pine data the ‘ hockey stick ' shape of his graph would vanish , because he had tried it himself . 
1	372	 One of the files they obtained from him showed the results of his own attempt to do this . 
1	372	 The file was marked ‘ Censored ' and its findings were nowhere mentioned in the published study . 
1	372	 What , however , concerned McIntyre and McKitrick as much as anything else about this extraordinary affair was what it revealed about the methods of the IPCC itself . 
1	372	 Why had it not subjected Mann 's study to the kind of basic professional checks which they themselves had been able to carry out , with such devastating results ? 
1	372	 Furthermore , having failed to exercise any proper quality control , why had those at the top of the IPCC then gone out of their way to give such extraordinary prominence to ‘ the hockey stick data as the canonical representation of the earth 's climate history . 
1	372	 Due to a combination of mathematical error and a dysfunctional review process , they ended up promoting the exact wrong conclusion . 
1	372	 How did they make such a blunder ? '

1	372	" What all this reveals , of course , is that the global warming "" hockey stick "" is fake science . "
1	372	 As Booker documents in his book , data were truncated ( cut off ) and software algorithms were altered to produce a hockey stick trend out of almost any data set , including random noise data .

1	375	From Israel 's prime minister down to the lowliest clerk , from the Commander in Chief down to the lowest ranking officer , from the Mossad down to the police by way of the Shabak - since 1994 , everyone has been chanting the same mantra about peace with Jordan . 
1	375	 The prevalent reasoning is that peace with Jordan is Israel 's most important strategic resource for the following reasons : 
1	375	 1.Security : The 500-kilometer border between Israel and Jordan is Israel 's longest border with another country , reaching from Hamat Gader and the Yarmouk River in the north down to Eilat in the south . 
1	375	 Jordan makes sure the border is quiet along its entire length and prevents hostile forces from approaching it and continuing west into Israel . 
1	375	 If not for the peace declared between the two states , Israel would have to keep large forces along the border to guard it against infiltration . 
1	375	 Israel sees the very existence of Jordan to its east as a security asset in itself because Jordan acts as a buffer zone between the Jewish state and the violent chaos in Iraq , Syria , and Iran . 
1	375	 There is full cooperation between the Jordanian and Israeli armies , including visits by officers , the handing over of information , and coordinated activity along the border , under the assumption that radical groups are a shared enemy . 
1	375	 In exchange for this , it is said , Israel played a part in guarding Jordan 's northern and eastern borders during the years 2014 - 16 , the period when ISIS posed a threat to Jordan . 
1	375	 2 . 
1	375	 Jordan is the second Arab nation to have signed a peace treaty with Israel , proving that Israel can find itself accepted in the Middle East as a sustainable country with whom former enemies can make peace by rethinking their previous positions . 
1	375	 This could occur despite the August 1967 Khartoum Arab summit where it was declared that the Arab nations would not recognize Israel , would not negotiate with Israel and would not make peace with it . 
1	375	 King Hussein of Jordan was a party to these decisions but carried on negotiations with Israel , recognized it and signed a peace treaty , as did Egypt before him . 
1	375	 The obvious conclusion is that any Arab nation can do the same , making peace with Jordan a significant accomplishment , 
1	375	 3 . 
1	375	 There is a wide array of cooperative ties between Israel and Jordan , mostly in the economic sphere . 
1	375	" Three issues are involved : a. Israel has a multi - billion dollar contract with Jordan according to which it sells gas extracted from Israel 's Mediterranean gas fields to Jordan 's electricity company ; b. Israel recognized "" Qualified Industrial Zones "" in which Israeli funds are invested , Jordanians are employed and Americans are the buyers , providing employment for thousands of Jordanian families ; c. cooperative ventures such as the Water Canal , tourism , flights , trade , and academia - thousands of Israeli Arab students attend Jordanian Universities and their degrees are recognized in Israel . "
1	375	 In exchange for recognition , Israel granted the Hashemite Kingdom , and especially its king , special status in the Jerusalem sites considered holy by Islam , mainly the al Aqsa Mosque , giving Hussein and his son Abdullah today , a significant stamp of approval in the Islamic world . 
1	375	 This stamp of approval is especially important in granting much - needed legitimacy to the Hashemite Kingdom . 
1	375	 The Palestinian majority and even some Bedouin groups question that legitimacy , since the Hashemites are not originally Jordanian , having come from the western section of the Arabian Peninsula , Hijaz , where the two Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina are located . 
1	375	 The British gave the Transjordan Emirate to Abdullah I , great grandfather of today 's Abdullah . 
1	375	 He is considered a foreign transplant , giving rise to questions of legitimate rule , and the special status at al Aqsa is intended to give him a shot of legitimacy , stabilizing his regime . 
1	375	 The king pays the salaries of hundreds of Jerusalem Waqf officials . 
1	375	 Another payment Israel took upon itself is the handing over of 50 million cubic meters of drinkable water to Jordan every year . 
1	375	 The plan was to bring this water from the Sea of Galilee , but the drought of the last few years has lowered the level of the water in the lake , so Israel has substituted expensive desalinated water instead . 
1	375	 Jordanian agriculture in the Jordan Valley is made possible in part because of this Israeli water . 
1	375	 All the points raised here give Israel the feeling that the peace agreement with Jordan is successful , certainly more successful than the one with Egypt , with whom there is much less cooperation on non - security related issues . 
1	375	 Israel 's payment for this by handing over water and securing Jordan 's status in Jerusalem is one Israel can handle in exchange for the premise that peace with Jordan serves Israeli interests . 
1	375	 All the parties to Israel 's government are united in supporting the maintenance of peace with Jordan at all costs . 
1	375	 Where did we go wrong ? 
1	375	 The first and main point is that Israel ignores the fact that the peace agreement is totally dependent on the continuation of the illegitimate Hashemite dynasty . 
1	375	 In 1994 that meant Hussein , today it is Abdullah II , but the future is unclear because there are quite a few people in Jordan and outside it who see Abdullah as the last Hashemite monarch . 
1	375	 What comes next ? 
1	375	 There are several possible answers to that query , ranging from a military junta made up of local Bedouin ruling the various populations , on to a civil war that leads to the country splitting in two , with a Palestinian state rising in the northwestern part of the country where there is a Palestinian Arab majority . 
1	375	 It is no secret that the Palestinian majority in Jordan is opposed to the peace treaty with Israel . 
1	375	" One reason is the recognition a treaty grants Israel and another is the fact that it does not include the so - called "" right of return "" of the 1948 refugees to within Israeli borders , including compensation for the possessions they left behind them and the years of suffering they underwent in refugee camps . "
1	375	 The Palestinian majority in Jordan feels no commitment to the peace agreement ; it was signed by King Hussein , not by them . 
1	375	 For this reason , most of the professional associations in Jordan - lawyers , journalists , doctors and others - do not allow their members to partner with Israelis . 
1	375	 Most of their members are Palestinian Arabs who see the peace agreement as the result of the king 's betrayal of their cause . 
1	375	 The peace agreement upon which Israel and Jordan are signed and everything Israel has paid , is paying and is willing to pay to preserve and guard that peace will be utterly worthless the day a rebellion breaks out against the king , or some assassin or suicide bomber , G - d forbid , succeeds in killing him . 
1	375	 The house of cards Israel built around him will collapse instantaneously , the peace agreement and any others signed in its wake will become fond memories . 
1	375	 Whoever takes the king 's place will restart the process and expect Israel to pay even more than it had originally paid - that is , if the country remains united . 
1	375	 If that new leader is a Palestinian Arab , the price will entail the return of a significant number of 1948 refugees to the state of Israel , not to the Palestinian State that may exist by then . 
1	375	 The king knows full well that the possibility that he could be assassinated by a Palestinian Arab , as his great grandfather was in 1951 in Jerusalem , is not far - fetched . 
1	375	 That is the reason his armed bodyguards are not Arabs , but members of the Circassian ethnic minority who stem from the Caucasian Mountain region and do not have their eyes on the throne , meaning that they are not suspected of planning to murder the king or poison his food . 
1	375	 The king 's mistrust of the Palestinian Arabs , who make up the majority of his subjects , has led him to keep them out of the armed forces , police , foreign ministry and especially from internal security organizations and intelligence . 
1	375	 There are several Palestinian Arabs in the government and parliament who serve as token representatives , but the majority of them know exactly what the Hashemites think of the majority of Jordan 's citizenry , those who define themselves as Palestinians - never calling themselves Jordanians because that is used for Bedouin , viewed as lower class by the Palestinians , who are farmers and city dwellers . 
1	375	 The Palestinian Arabs in Jordan are the economic engine of the country . 
1	375	 They make up most of the merchants , manufacturers , businessmen , lawyers , accountants , academics , journalists , arts and media personalities , and they generally avoid contact with Israel and Israelis . 
1	375	 They conduct a consistent and strict boycott of Israel . 
1	375	 The king respects their position for two reasons : One , he has no way to force the peace agreement upon them , and two , he is quite content to show Israel that the peace agreement is not secure because of Palestinian opposition , allowing him to demand more and more from Israel in order to guard its interests and keep the king in power . 
1	375	 The cost of the peace agreement with Israel is prohibitive . 
1	375	 First , Israel respects the status it granted the kingdom in Jerusalem , even though there is no precedent in the entire world for a sovereign state granting another country special rights in its capital city on that state 's most holy site . 
1	375	 In 1994 , when this was decided during the peace talks , Israel was n't worried about Hussein who hated Arafat and agreed with Israel that there must never be a Palestinian state . 
1	375	 The status Israel granted him on the Temple Mount was in order to prevent Arafat and the Islamic Movement from taking over the site . 
1	375	 King Abdullah II has turned Jordanian policy around and is an ardent supporter of the establishment of a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria . , 
1	375	 one that will be able to look over at Israel and threaten it with missiles and short range mortars that hit from Dimona and Beer Sheva in the south , up along the coastal plain from Ashkelon , the Ashdod port , greater Tel Aviv , Ben Gurion airport , to Haifa and its port and all the way to Afula and Beit She'an . 
1	375	 Long range weapons will threaten all the rest of Israel . 
1	375	 Abdullah is actively creating a strategic threat to the state of Israel that will most probably be ruled by Hamas , which won most of the seats in the Palestinian legislature in 2006 and led a violent takeover of Gaza in 2007 . 
1	375	 Abdullah would like to see these scenarios repeat themselves , a most realistic possibility . 
1	375	 King Abdullah displayed his hostility towards Israel poverty in two recent events . 
1	375	" This past March he freed the Jordanian soldier who , in cold blood , murdered seven school girls from Beit Shemesh in 1997 as they took part in a class trip to the "" Peace Island "" ( ! ! ! ) "
1	375	 in Naharayim . 
1	375	 His father , King Hussein , came to pay a condolence visit to the families in Beit Shemesh , while his son lets the murderer go free . 
1	375	 What price did he pay for this slap in the face to Israel ? 
1	375	 Zilch . 
1	375	 Nothing . 
1	375	 Jordan acts against Israel as a matter of course in international circles , especially UNESCO and the UN Human Rights Council , two places that constantly attempt to delegitimize Israel . 
1	375	 Jordan encourages and pushes for the decisions that deny Jewish tradition in Jerusalem , undermining the historical and religious foundations for the existence of the Jewish State . 
1	375	" This is meant to spread the feeling to the world that Israel 's establishment is a result of British colonialism , one that must be canceled so that "" Falestin "" is restored to its "" historical owners "" - the Palestinians . "
1	375	 Abdullah , like the Palestinian Arabs , thinks that if he succeeds in removing Jerusalem from the State of Israel , the resulting demoralization will send the Jews packing . 
1	375	 Establishing a Palestinian Arab state that will threaten Israel 's security and destroy the Jewish state , is the strategic objective of King Abdullah because it will prevent a Palestinian State from arising in Jordan . 
1	375	 If a Palestinian state is created in the hills of Judea and Samaria , the king intends to get rid of all the Palestinian refugees who entered Jordan in the 1948 war , about one and a half million people , plus several hundred thousand who entered Jordan over the last seventy years . 
1	375	 A demographic pressure in the Palestinian state will become terrorist pressure that turns life in Israel into Hell - exactly what Abdullah wants . 
1	375	 He coordinates his activities with Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas , seeing eye to eye with them on the main goal - destroying Israel in order to save the Hashemite Kingdom from becoming a nation of Palestinians . 
1	375	 We would do well to remember what most of us have long forgotten : The clueless group of irresponsible Israeli politicians who gave Jordan its unconditional and unlimited special status in Jerusalem is the same group whose idiotic policies brought terrorist Arafat back from the garbage bin of politicians in Tunisia and granted him the closest thing to a state , The stars of this stellar group included Shimon Peres , Yossi Beilin , and Alon Liel , who dragged Yitzchak Rabin into the most dangerous political trap , endangering the continued existence of the State of Israel . 
1	375	 Jordan today , it must be concluded , is working non - stop on the cover of its peace treaty with Israel to destroy the Jewish State and create a Palestinian one instead . 
1	375	 What is worse is that Israel refuses to admit to the situation and continues most carefully to keep the agreement , hoping calm will prevail along the border until the next elections . 
1	375	 Every politician knows that if during his term , relations with Jordan deteriorate , the media - our shallow , slanted and agenda - ridden media - will accuse him of being the cause of the agreement 's nullification , making him pay the price for the next round of elections . 
1	375	 That is why politicians bolster up the temporary tactical quiet , ignoring the strategic threat to the very existence of the state posed by the peace agreement . 
1	375	 If Israel 's leaders felt endangered by the actions of Abdullah , they would do something to prevent his destructive activities , cleverly disguised as military and economic cooperation . 
1	375	 The problem is that in their view , short term tactical advantages are preferable to attending to strategic problems that affect the long term . 
1	375	 We are all going to pay a high price for this way of running things on the part of Israel 's decision makers - as can be seen by the security equipment crisis last month in Jerusalem . 
1	375	 King Hussein was all for Israel 's continued existence and did not question Jerusalem ‘s status . 
1	375	 That 's why peace with him was positive in general . 
1	375	 His son Abdullah changed his father 's strategy and works tirelessly to create a Palestinian state on the ruins of the destroyed Jewish one . 
1	375	 Now that King Abdullah 's nefarious scheme has been revealed , Israel must rethink its Jordanian route and work to create a Palestinian Arab state in all or part of Jordan , since the majority of the people there are Palestinian Arabs . 
1	375	 The alternative is establishing a Palestinian state on Israeli territory with its capital in Eastern Jerusalem , a strategic danger to Israel . 
1	375	 There is no reason that the Jewish people , who returned to its land after 2000 years of exile , should pay with its very existence for the survival of the Hashemites brought by the British from Hijaz to rule the most artificial country in the world - Jordan .

0	376	President Donald Trump is calling on NFL players once again to stand during the national anthem . 
0	376	 He tweeted Saturday that players should stand on Sunday , saying they should respect the U.S. flag and country . 
0	376	 More than 200 players either knelt or used other means as expressions of unity last weekend . 
0	376	 NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart said such actions are not a protest against the anthem or the flag . 
0	376	 The players knelt last weekend in response to social injustice . 
0	376	 Full teams , along with some team owners , linked arms either before or during the anthem . 
0	376	 Three teams — Pittsburgh , Seattle and Tennessee — did not take the field until after the anthem . 
0	376	 Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow , and always , for the playing of our National Anthem . 
0	376	 Respect our Flag and our Country ! 
0	376	 — Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) September 30 , 2017 
0	376	 Trump had earlier called on NFL owners to fire players who did n't stand for the anthem . 
0	376	" Previously , Trump also said National Football League team owners are "" afraid of their players . "" "
0	376	 Earlier this week , he called for action against those who kneel during the national anthem to protest racial injustice . 
0	376	" Trump said he began criticizing the players because he has "" so many friends that are owners . "" "
0	376	" He added : "" I think they are afraid of their players , if you want to know the truth , and I think it 's disgraceful . "" "
0	376	" The president spoke in an interview that aired Thursday on "" Fox and Friends . "" "
0	376	" He says "" most people agree "" with him . "
0	376	" NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart called the president 's statements "" inaccurate . "" "
0	376	" "" I believe there was a statement our owners are afraid of our players and owners requested intervention by political leaders to kick this off , "" Lockhart said . "" "
0	376	" Those statements are not accurate . "" "
0	376	 Trump has spent days attacking players who kneel during the anthem . 
0	376	 He insists the NFL should require players to stand . 
0	376	 Responding to Trump , hundreds more players have been sitting , kneeling , locking arms or remaining in locker rooms . 
0	376	 If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL , or other leagues , he or she should not be allowed to disrespect .... 
0	376	 — Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) September 23 , 2017 
0	376	 ... our Great American Flag ( or Country ) and should stand for the National Anthem . 
0	376	 If not , YOU'RE FIRED . 
0	376	 Find something else to do ! 
0	376	 — Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) September 23 , 2017 
0	376	" "" The owners are clearly united in a sense that the attacks on the game , on the NFL , on the players were unfair and unfounded , and that there was unity among the group , "" Lockhart said , noting that about two - thirds of the 32 team owners were at league headquarters this week for committee meetings . "
0	376	" "" I think there was also a sentiment ... that the issues are being obscured and distorted by people with political agendas , "" Lockhart said . "" "
0	376	" I think they made it clear they support our players , but also support our country , the national anthem , the flag — all of the things some have suggested we do n't . "" "

1	378	Hurricane Harvey reveals an America that many in the media seem not to know exists : a multi - ethnic , multiracial country where people , for the most part , get along . 
1	378	" For those who claim that President Donald Trump "" coarsened "" our politics and "" set back race relations , "" Hurricane Harvey was pretty bad optics . "
1	378	 Only weeks ago , some Democrats were counting the days toward Trump 's impeachment and an early departure from the presidency . 
1	378	 But last week they saw Trump , in Texas , looking quite presidential in his role as comforter in chief . 
1	378	 They saw photos of a president soothing and embracing survivors , no matter their race or gender or sexual orientation . 
1	378	 If he is a germaphobe , his fear must be in remission , as he hugged adult survivors and held kids in his arms . 
1	378	" Texans , including black ones , appeared pleased by Trump 's visit even as Democrats like Maxine Waters have denounced him as "" racist , "" calling for his impeachment as Harvey was bearing down on Texas . "
1	378	 Imagine this : neighbors helping neighbors , irrespective of race . 
1	378	 But really , this is an old American story . 
1	378	 Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville traveled to this fascinating new country called the United States of America in the 1830s . 
1	378	" He wrote about what he considered an astonishing number of "" mutual aid societies , "" or charitable organizations and clubs set up to help a community 's needy . "
1	378	" Tocqueville wrote : "" Americans group together to hold fetes , found seminaries , build inns , construct churches , distribute books , dispatch missionaries to the antipodes . "
1	378	 They establish hospitals , prisons , schools by the same method . 
1	378	 Finally , if they wish to highlight a truth or develop an opinion by the encouragement of a great example , they form an association . ... 
1	378	" "" The love and respect of your neighbors must be gained by a long series of small services , hidden deeds of goodness , a persistent habit of kindness , and an established reputation of selflessness . ... "
1	378	" I have seen Americans making great and sincere sacrifices for the key common good and a hundred times I have noticed that , when needs be , they almost always gave each other faithful support . "" "
1	378	" Tocqueville considered Americans ' remarkable spirit of charitable giving a matter of enlightened self - interest : "" American moralists do not claim that one must sacrifice oneself for one 's fellows because it is a fine thing to do but they are bold enough to say that such sacrifices are as necessary to the man who makes them as to those gaining from them . ... "
1	378	 They do not , therefore , deny that every man can pursue his own self - interest but they turn themselves inside out to prove that it is in each man 's interest to be virtuous . ... 
1	378	" Enlightened self - love continually leads them to help one another and inclines them to devote freely a part of their time and wealth to the welfare of the state . "" "
1	378	 America just elected and re - elected a black president . 
1	378	" Still , President Barack Obama famously said racism is "" still part of ( America 's ) DNA . "" "
1	378	 Well , America 's DNA clearly changed , and dramatically so . 
1	378	" In 1958 , when Gallup asked whether Americans would vote for a black person for president , 54 percent said , "" No . "" "
1	378	 A 2006 Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll found just 3 percent of Republicans and 4 percent of Democrats said they would not vote for a black presidential candidate . 
1	378	 In fact , more Americans ( 14 percent ) said they would not vote for a Mormon or a 72-year - old than the number who refused to vote for a black president . 
1	378	 In the 1950s , interracial black - white marriages were extremely rare . 
1	378	 Today , intermarriage of all races and ethnicities accounts for 17 percent of all marriages . 
1	378	 This is why sane observers of O.J. Simpson 's 1995 murder trial considered its defense a joke : that LAPD officers , including an Asian - American criminalist , seething at Simpson for having married a blue - eyed blonde , leaped at their opportunity to frame him . 
1	378	 In liberal Los Angeles , where intermarriage is common ? 
1	378	 In the 1950s over 90 percent of Americans disapproved of black - white marriages , while recent polls say about 90 percent approve . 
1	378	 If America were as racist as many in the media think , why do blacks excel in two of the most competitive fields -- sports and entertainment ? 
1	378	 On Forbes ' list of highest - earning celebrities , blacks occupy seven of the top 25 slots , including Sean Combs , who clocks in at $ 130 million annually ; Beyonce at $ 105 million ; and Drake at $ 94 million . 
1	378	 On Forbes ' list of highest - earning athletes , blacks occupy 13 of the top 25 spots , including LeBron James at $ 86 million ; Kevin Durant at $ 60 million ; and Stephen Curry at $ 47 million . 
1	378	 Watch out , Trump - hating media . 
1	378	 As more blacks recognize that Republicans are not out to get them , and they look at cities like Detroit under Democratic leadership , Trump can potentially tip the black vote in his party 's direction more than any Republican since Abraham Lincoln .

0	380	 Day One  is a multi - part series in which CBS News ' Margaret Brennan speaks with former U.S. government officials on the major foreign policy issues the next president will inherit on the first day of their presidency . 
0	380	 The next president will face countless challenges on day one . 
0	380	 Among the biggest is the ongoing civil war in Syria . 
0	380	 Margaret Brennan spoke with Leon Panetta -- a former CIA director , defense secretary , and White House chief of staff -- about the road ahead for U.S. involvement in the war - torn nation . 
0	380	 LEON PANETTA : Inaction is not an option in Syria because if you stand back , the situation is gon na get worse . 
0	380	 Look , the best - case scenario would be to have Assad step down , to have a transitional government be able to establish itself representing each of the factions that are there -- the Sunnis , the Kurds , the Shias . 
0	380	 And then , frankly , have the Russians and whatever is left of the Syrian forces join with the United States in going after ISIS to truly defeat them . 
0	380	 That would be the best - case scenario . 
0	380	 MARGARET BRENNAN : What are the odds of that ? 
0	380	 PANETTA : Not very good . 
0	380	 Not very good . 
0	380	 BRENNAN : What 's the worst - case scenario ? 
0	380	 PANETTA : The worst - case scenario is that Assad continues to remain in power , continues to kill Syrians . 
0	380	 That refugees continue to flow out of Syria , that the Russians continue to have a presence there and continue to attack our moderate forces that we 're trying to train in Syria . 
0	380	 And that ISIS then uses that and creates an even bigger base from which to conduct attacks against this country . 
0	380	 That 's the worst - case scenario . 
0	380	 BRENNAN : Sounds like you 're describing what 's happening now . 
0	380	 PANETTA : It is what 's happening now . 
0	380	 And it 's what can continue to happen in the future if we do n't deal with it . 
0	380	 BRENNAN : There are around 300 special operators in Syria right now . 
0	380	 Will the next president have to commit more American boots on the ground ? 
0	380	 PANETTA : I think the likelihood is that the next president is gon na have to consider adding additional special forces on the ground to try to assist those moderate forces that are taking on ISIS , and that are taking on Assad 's forces . 
0	380	 And we have to increase our air strikes . 
0	380	 We 've got to do all of those things in order to put increasing pressure on ISIS but also on Assad . 
0	380	 We ca n't surrender one objective for the other . 
0	380	 We 've got ta continue to press on both fronts . 
0	380	 BRENNAN : Is it possible to defeat ISIS without challenging Assad ? 
0	380	 PANETTA : I think it 's very difficult as we 've seen to conduct effective operations against ISIS when we 're dealing with Assad 's forces pressing us in different places . 
0	380	 And when we 're dealing with the Russians who go in and literally bomb the very forces that we 're training to go after Assad and to go after ISIS . 
0	380	 We can not have that situation continue in the future . 
0	380	 Protect our forces there . 
0	380	 BRENNAN : So the U.S. has to confront Russia ? 
0	380	 PANETTA : We are hoping upon hope that the Russians will do the right thing . 
0	380	 They 're not gon na do the right thing without pressure . 
0	380	 They 're not gon na do the right thing without giving our diplomats greater leverage than what they have now to deal with the Russians . 
0	380	 To do that we have got to make very clear that we have objectives to achieve , that we intend to press to achieve those objectives , and that we will not allow them to divert us from the goals of defending ourselves . 
0	380	 Here 's where the candidates stand : 
0	380	 Hillary Clinton wants to increase airstrikes against ISIS . 
0	380	 She said she would arm the moderate rebels , and pressure Russia to get out of Syria . 
0	380	 We should add that Panetta is advising the Clinton campaign .

1	381	LifeZette editor - in - chief says Democrats , establishment GOP ‘ happiest ' when president struggles 
1	381	 By Kathryn Blackhurst ; LifeZette : 
1	381	" LifeZette Editor - in - Chief Laura Ingraham said that Never - Trumper Republicans and resisting liberals are "" happiest "" when President Donald Trump 's approval numbers go down , even if their own numbers plummet as well . "
1	381	" Ingraham , who was guest - hosting Tuesday on Fox News ' "" Tucker Carlson Tonight , "" blasted balking GOP members of Congress and Democrats for blocking and stalling the president 's legislative agenda throughout his first 200 days in office . "
1	381	 Noting that Republican senators such as Jeff Flake ( Arizona ) , John McCain ( Arizona ) , and Thom Tillis ( North Carolina ) delight in making rounds on the news talk shows to criticize Trump , Ingraham pointed out their own plunging approval numbers as the American voters wait for them to fulfill their campaign promises . 
1	381	" "" Do you know what a liberal 's idea of Armageddon is ? "
1	381	 No , it 's not a nuclear North Korea , but a successful Trump presidency . 
1	381	 Do you know what the Never - Trump Republicans on Capitol Hill fear the most ? 
1	381	" No , it 's not ISIS and it 's not a 5,000-point [ drop ] in the Dow , but a successful Trump presidency , "" Ingraham said . "
1	381	" "" Today is the 200th day of this administration , "" she added . "" "
1	381	" And despite the hyperventilation and alarmism we 're hearing from the national press corps — they 're prematurely declaring the Trump administration a failure , of course — but in fact , it 's the resistance to Trump that is playing a risky gambit . "" "
1	381	 No compatible source was found for this video . 
1	381	" In this "" resistance , "" Ingraham included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) , "
1	381	" and "" supposed right "" senators such as Flake , McCain and Tillis . "
1	381	" And what unites all of them is their sad and rather pathetic fear and loathing of President Trump , "" she said . "" "
1	381	 So they want you so saturated in this endless and mindless Russia story deal , and other irrelevant West Wing staff intrigues that 's mostly fueled by leaks , that you even begin to believe their negative spin . 
1	381	 And let 's face it — these people are happiest when his numbers go down , when his legislation and his confirmations stall , even if their own approval numbers go down , too . 
1	381	" It 's like they do n't even care . "" "
1	381	 Pointing to recent Quinnipiac University poll measuring congressional approval ratings , Ingraham noted these politicians have plummeted even as Trump 's numbers have dwindled into the 30s . 
1	381	" "" And Trump 's approval rating may only be about 37 percent according to one poll , but check this out . "
1	381	 Tom Tillis ' approval rating , North Carolina — 29 percent . 
1	381	 Nancy Pelosi 's — 27 percent . 
1	381	" Chuck Schumer 's is 26 percent , and [ Senate Majority Leader ] Mitch McConnell 's is a very impressive 17 percent , "" Ingraham said , noting that McConnell has failed repeatedly to rally 50 of 52 GOP senators in support of various measures to repeal and replace Obamacare . "
1	381	" "" Now despite two years of non - stop bile and vitriol from Washington 's bipartisan elite class , Trump is actually beating all of them , "" she added . "" "
1	381	" Now while of course it 's true that key legislative successes are lacking , whether on health care , tax reform , infrastructure — but it 's equally true as well that President Trump has done a lot even without Congress to make our lives better . "" "
1	381	" Ingraham said that Trump does need to work on boosting his approval numbers , but she argued the president has "" done a heck of a lot in just 200 days . "" "
1	381	 Pointing to the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch , Trump 's slashing of Obama - era red - tape and regulations , the thriving stock market , consumer confidence and more , Ingraham said that Trump 's presidency has n't been the failure that the media , the Left and the Never - Trumpers are making it out to be . 
1	381	" "" His approval numbers — yeah , they need boosting , that 's for sure . "
1	381	" But considering the 24/7 media onslaught against him , the distraction of the Russia probe , and the resistance from Congress — both sides in Congress — he 's done a heck of a lot in just 200 days , "" she said . "" "
1	381	" And if he can keep focused and he can keep his team motivated , keep them together , and put pressure on the Hill to deliver on some of these big issues , he 'll improve his numbers and he 'll grow the populist movement . "" "

0	383	 Crews added that he told everyone he knew and worked with about what happened to him . 
0	383	 And that the executive called him the next day to apologise , but never explained his reason for the assault .

0	383	" "" Hopefully , me coming forward with my story will deter a predator and encourage someone who feels hopeless . "" "
0	383	 It comes after a number of high - profile women in Hollywood went public with claims of inappropriate behavior by film producer Weinstein , including Gwyneth Paltrow , Angelina Jolie , Mira Sorvino , Asia Argento , and Rosanna Arquette .

1	385	 Many arrests have been made and the government of Iran says it may seek the death penalty , for what they say are crimes against God , in demonstrations that have gone on for over 5 days in a row .

1	385	 That is a dangerous situation , especially because of the over estimates of shale oil output . 
1	385	 ETF reports that this has led to the lowest ever volumes of oil discoveries in 2017 , Rystad Energy said last week . 
1	385	 While the low - level of discoveries is not an immediate threat to global oil supply , it could become a threat ten years down the road , according to Rystad Energy . 
1	385	 In ten years ' time , U.S. shale production may peak , at least according to OPEC that sees shale peaking after 2025 , although the cartel has conceded that U.S. tight oil has defied previous forecasts and has increased production more than initially expected and will continue to do so in the short - term . 
1	385	 This year has seen less than 7 billion barrels of oil equivalent discovered globally , a volume as low as last seen in the 1940s , Rystad Energy has estimated . 
1	385	 What worries analysts the most is the fact that this year the reserve replacement ratio - the amount of discovered resources relative to the amount of production - was a mere 11 percent , compared to 50 percent in 2012 , Sonia Mladá Passos , Senior Analyst at Rystad Energy , said . 
1	385	 The other ongoing risk is Venezuela . 
1	385	 An explosion over the weekend that hit Venezuela 's largest refinery was an accident waiting to happen . 
1	385	 Deferred maintenance and bad management as the Venezuelan government stole money and failed to do even the most basic maintenance for the facility according to sources . 
1	385	 Reuters reported that a former oil minister excoriated Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a newspaper column on Sunday , accusing the leftist leader of behaving like biblical King Herod and plunging the oil - rich nation into economic devastation . 
1	385	 Rafael Ramirez , who was the all - powerful head of the oil ministry and state energy company PDVSA for a decade , has long been a rival of Maduro . 
1	385	 In recent months , Ramirez has grown increasingly critical of Maduro 's handling of a fourth straight year of recession that has triggered malnutrition , widespread food and medicine shortages , the world 's steepest inflation , and a surge in emigration . 
1	385	" A furious Maduro ordered Ramirez to resign as the nation 's United Nations ambassador in New York last month after an article entitled the "" The Storm "" was perceived as an attack on his government . "
1	385	 We have n't even got to the cold . 
1	385	 Wicked winter weather is causing a surge in oil and natural gas and coal demand . 
1	385	 Demand for coal burns hit three - year high causing to temporarily put it above natural gas as the top s U.S. power sources . 
1	385	 There are reports that they were shortages of natural gas in Northern Alberta county under state of emergency due to natural gas disruption . 
1	385	 The report said that large parts of northern Alberta was under a state of emergency over the weekend due to low natural gas pressure and system outages . 
1	385	 The Energy Report has kept our bullish outlook and we still believe that the double bottom at $ 26 a barrel was a generational low . 
1	385	 Despite all the bearish hype that the market had last year and bad info this year oil looks poised for a big move .

1	386	 The NRA 's Dana Loesch ad calls for nothing more than the truth , and obviously that is more than the progressive left can take .  
1	386	 Recently the NRA put out a new ad featuring their female spokesperson Dana Loesch that calls for people to join the NRA . 
1	386	 The ad has been called many things across social media . 
1	386	 Many on the left are calling it an outright call for violence against the left and protesters . 
1	386	 They cry that it is attempting to incite violence . 
1	386	" Some even said it was "" barely a whisper shy of a call for full civil war . "" "
1	386	 Now I am a firm believer in the right of all people to defend themselves . 
1	386	 The ad is very easy to understand , and pretty straight forward if you are a logical and sensible person . 
1	386	 But if you are looking for a reason to incite violence I guess you can try and twist the words of the ad to suit your needs . 
1	386	 Here is the transcript of the ad : 
1	386	" "" They use their media to assassinate real news . "
1	386	 They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler . 
1	386	 They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again . 
1	386	 And then they use their ex - president to endorse the resistance . 
1	386	" "" All to make them march , make them protest , make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia . "
1	386	 To smash windows , burn cars , shut down interstates and airports , bully and terrorize the law - abiding — until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness . 
1	386	" "" And when that happens , they 'll use it as an excuse for their outrage . "
1	386	 The only way we stop this , the only way we save our country and our freedom , is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth . 
1	386	" I 'm the National Rifle Association of America , and I 'm freedom 's safest place . "" "
1	386	" The only thing in the entire ad that talks about fighting back is this one line , "" to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth "" . "
1	386	 Now if that calls for attacks and violence against others , you really are stretching your imagination a bit and need to look at all the other things listed that are already being done by the anti - American types . 
1	386	 Now I may be just a simple man , and try to look at things as logically as I can , but in listening to the ad , and reading the transcript , all I see is the statement of facts on how some people act , and that you confront them with the truth . 
1	386	" The reference to the "" fist "" is in reference to the fist emblem used by the "" resist "" movement , not the NRA . "
1	386	 I have found in debating people online ( @downrangewithcw ) that when you bring out the facts and truth , they resort to name calling and ugly threats . 
1	386	 The reasons that progressives use violence against law - abiding innocent citizens are simple and straightforward . 
1	386	 In addition , remember those reasons which Dana Loesch mentions are already used to commit riots and violence against communities across this country . 
1	386	 No compatible source was found for this video . 
1	386	 So to all of those that are crying that the ad incites violence and calls for a civil war , I say get a life ! 
1	386	 You are what is wrong with this country . 
1	386	 Here we have a spokesperson talking about using truth to combat violence and you , the ones complaining about the ad are whining that it calls for violence . 
1	386	" I hate to break it to you , if you thought Ms. Loesch 's words were inciting you must be apoplectic in reading my article "" Protesters Be Warned "" where I discuss the facts surrounding the lawful use of force to defend yourself if confronted by a violent crowd . "
1	386	 It 's time for the people that think it is OK to violently protest anything that comes to mind to understand that a time is coming when they will find that the law abiding people of this country , who would love nothing more than to be left alone , will no longer allow their businesses or homes to be burned and looted . 
1	386	 People will no longer allow themselves to be dragged from their cars and beaten for simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time . 
1	386	 The NRA 's Dana Loesch ad calls for nothing more than the truth , and obviously is more than the progressive left can take . 
1	386	 You know the old saying , the truth hurts , does n't it ! 
1	386	 Oh , I guess that is calling for violence too .Does the New NRA Ad with Dana Loesch Call for Violence ?

1	387	 UPDATED 10/18/17 , 2:45 p.m. ET : 
1	387	 NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell held a press conference on Wednesday and spoke about how the NFL wants players to stand during the national anthem . 
1	387	 However , he also reemphasized that the league will not try to force players to stand at this point . 
1	387	" "" We just had two days of conversation of which this was a fair amount of dialogue and I think we all see this the same way , "" Goodell said . "" "
1	387	 We want our players to stand . 
1	387	 Our focus is on the opportunity we have to make our communities better through these efforts with our players . 
1	387	" We 'll deal with these issues as they come up . "" "
1	387	 Goodell steered clear of directly addressing the tweet Donald Trump sent out on Wednesday about the NFL 's decision not to force players to stand . 
1	387	" Goodell : "" were focusing on what we should be doing as the NFL , "" in response to more questions about Trump 's Tweets "
1	387	 — Jason La Canfora ( @JasonLaCanfora ) October 18 , 2017 
1	387	" Additionally , Goodell said he wants the league to "" stay out of politics "" and talked about how he hopes that there will eventually be "" zero "" players kneeling during the anthem . "
1	387	 See original story below . 
1	387	 As per usual , Donald Trump 's using his personal Twitter account to spew garbage takes about shit he does n't truly understand . 
1	387	 Just a week after saying a one - game suspension would have scared Colin Kaepernick from kneeling in protest of the national anthem ever again ( ROFL ) , he 's back on Twitter clapping at the NFL for not bringing the hammer down on players who are still protesting . 
1	387	 The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem . 
1	387	 Total disrespect for our great country ! 
1	387	 — Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) October 18 , 2017 
1	387	" "" The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem , "" Trump tweeted . "" "
1	387	" Total disrespect for our great country ! "" "
1	387	 This is no doubt in response to the NFL saying they would not prohibit players from protesting the anthem late last week . 
1	387	 If Trump was so concerned about players protesting the national anthem — which , again is a part of the First Amendment — why does n't he stop the police from murdering black people ? 
1	387	 You know , what these fucking protests are actually about . 
1	387	 If Trump 's so concerned about people openly resisting the tradition of bigging up America before playing a game , why does n't he go to the root of the problem ? 
1	387	" Oh right , because while he spews a hatred for "" fake news , "" he has no problem feeding the fuckery . "

0	388	Earlier this year , two hunters suffered gun - related injuries while camped out at the Circle Dug Ranch , a Texas ranch near the U.S .- Mexico border . 
0	388	 According to Texas Monthly , a 26-year - old hunting guide named Walker Daugherty was shot in the abdomen . 
0	388	 One of his clients , 59-year - old Edwin Roberts , was shot in the arm . 
0	388	 When Daugherty reported the incident to law enforcement officials , he and his fiancée claimed that the gunfire came from illegal Mexican immigrants who were attempting to steal the Daugherty 's RV and kidnap their clients . 
0	388	 After the incident , a GoFundMe page was launched to help Daugherty pay for his medical expenses . 
0	388	 According to KOSA CBS 7 , the now - inactive campaign page stated that Daugherty was shot by illegal immigrants who were trying to steal his RV . 
0	388	 More than $ 25,000 was raised to cover Daugherty 's medical expenses . 
0	388	 CREDIT : Credit : GoFundMe 
0	388	" Upon hearing the story , Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller posted a message to Facebook calling Daugherty a hero and pledging his support for a border wall . "" "
0	388	" This is why we need the wall and to secure our borders , "" wrote Miller . "
0	388	 According to the Dallas News , the post was shared 6,500 times before Miller deleted it . 
0	388	 Weeks later , law enforcement officials determined Daugherty 's story was false . 
0	388	 According to KOSA CBS 7 in Texas , an investigation by the Presidio County Sheriff 's Department found that the gunfire did not come from immigrants crossing the border — it came from the hunters themselves . 
0	388	 That 's right : friendly fire . 
0	388	 Investigators determined that Daugherty shot Roberts and that another hunting guide , Michael Bryant , shot Daugherty . 
0	388	 The Daugherty family reportedly released a statement about the Presidio County Sheriff 's investigation that was published on the blog The Westerner . 
0	388	" "" We do not deny that our hunter client was hit by a bullet that resulted from a horribly fearful and confusing situation . "
0	388	 However , the bullet that shot our son was not . 
0	388	 That shot came later and from an entirely different direction . 
0	388	" We are unable to reveal all the details of the event at this time but we do not agree with the Sherriff 's stated conclusion to the incident . "" "

0	389	The NFL will not discipline the St. Louis Rams players who held up their hands as a gesture of solidarity with protesters in Ferguson , Missouri , prior to Sunday 's win over the Oakland Raiders . 
0	389	" "" We respect and understand the concerns of all individuals who have expressed views on this tragic situation , "" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in a statement on Monday . "
0	389	" Stedman Bailey , Tavon Austin , Jared Cook , Chris Givens and Kenny Britt emerged from the tunnel during pregame introductions Sunday using the "" Hands Up , Do n't Shoot "" pose adopted by protesters following the August shooting death of 18-year - old Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson . "
0	389	 The St. Louis County prosecutor 's office announced last week that it will not indict Wilson for the fatal confrontation , a decision that led to unrest in Ferguson and protests across the nation . 
0	389	" The St. Louis Police Officers Association released a statement that it was "" profoundly disappointed "" by the display while "" calling for the players involved to be disciplined and for the Rams and the NFL to deliver a very public apology . "" "
0	389	 After Sunday 's 52 - 0 win over the Raiders , Cook explained the thought process behind the pregame gesture . 
0	389	" "" We kind of came collectively together and decided we wanted to do something , "" Cook said via ESPN.com . "" "
0	389	 We have n't been able to go down to Ferguson to do anything because we have been busy . 
0	389	 Secondly , it 's kind of dangerous down there and none of us want to get caught up in anything . 
0	389	" "" So we wanted to come out and show our respect to the protests and the people who have been doing a heck of a job around the world . "" "
0	389	 UPDATE : The Rams issued a statement on the matter Monday evening :

0	391	Could Hurricane Matthew hit America ? 
0	391	" The National Hurricane Centre ( NHC ) said the hurricane is bringing "" devastating "" storm surge , extreme winds and heavy rains "" to extensive parts of Florida . "
0	391	" "" Extremely dangerous hurricane Matthew heading for Florida , "" the NHC warned last night . "
0	391	" "" If you are one of ~1.5 million people in Florida under evacuation instructions , leave those storm surge areas and mobile homes now ! "" "
0	391	 The latest map , from the NHC , shows that the eye of the hurricane is travelling along the coast of Florida towards Georgia and the Carolinas . 
0	391	 It is not yet known if the hurricane will go back out to sea after passing Florida but before reaching the other states further north . 
0	391	 The governors of Florida , Goergia the Carolinas have declared a state of emergency amid fears that the storm could wreak havoc on today . 
0	391	 The NHC said that the hurricane is due to track run parallel along the coast of Florida and Georgia all the way to South Carolina . 
0	391	" It added that just a "" small deviation "" off track could bring the major onshore with terrible consequences . "
0	391	 A Hurricane Warning is in effect along the East Coast from Florida to South Carolina . 
0	391	 A Hurricane Watch alert is also affecting parts of North Carolina . 
0	391	" It added : "" Although strong winds and heavy rain are being experienced , the eye and thus the strongest winds are currently remaining just offshore . "
0	391	" "" Hurricane force winds are very close to the coast of Florida and the outer eyewall of Matthew is touching Cape Canaveral . "
0	391	" A wind gust of 107 mph was recently recorded . "" "
0	391	" "" When a hurricane is forecast to track roughly parallel to a coastline - as Matthew is forecast to go from Florida through South Carolina - it becomes very difficult to estimate the impacts this far in advance , "" the NHC added . "
0	391	 This map shows the possible path of the hurricane 
0	391	" The Met Office said : "" It is likely the eye of Hurricane Matthew will pass very close to the entire eastern coastline of the US state on Friday . "
0	391	" "" Over the weekend it is expected that Matthew will weaken and turn north and northeast and affect the coastal areas of Georgia and the Carolinas . "
0	391	" "" However , this is the point at which uncertainty grows in forecasts . "
0	391	" "" It is looking increasingly likely that later in the weekend Matthew will turn out to sea , but the timing of this can not be stated with certainty . "
0	391	" "" Thus it is unclear how far north along the US coast will see impacts from Matthew . "" "
0	391	" Met Office tropical prediction scientist Julian Heming explained that there are differences between the models that track the "" very oblique "" path of the hurricane towards the US . "
0	391	 Will Hurricane Matthew hit the Carolinas ? 
0	391	 A full evacuation has been announced in South Carolina after Hurricane Matthew tore its way through the Caribbean . 
0	391	 A state of emergency has been declared across the whole state of South Carolina and 1.1million people are set to be evacuated across the state . 
0	391	 South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley urged communities along to coast to evacuate at least 100 miles away and fill their cars full of gas before they set off on their journeys . 
0	391	" A NHC spokesman said the eye of the hurricane looks "" like it 's going to impact the Carolinas "" at the end of the week or over the weekend . "
0	391	 North Carolina 's Governor Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency in 66 counties in central and eastern North Carolina . 
0	391	 Parts of North Carolina have been evacuated . 
0	391	 Mr McCrory also called on farmers to harvest their crops as soon as possible to prevent devastating flood damage if the hurricane hits . 
0	391	" "" We want to have everything in place early prior to the potential of an earthquake hitting North Carolina , "" he said . "
0	391	" "" I 'm hoping this is a false alarm but we ca n't gamble - we wo n't gamble - with people 's lives . "" "
0	391	 Met Office Will Hurricane Matthew hit Georgia ? 
0	391	 Large swathes of Georgia have been evacuated and there is a state of emergency in place . 
0	391	 But Georgia might be spared if the eye of the hurricane goes back out to sea before reaching the state . 
0	391	" Mr Heming warned that the hurricane was approaching the US at an oblique angle which means that "" small shifts can make a big difference "" . "
0	391	 Even if the eye of the hurricane does not hit Georgia , there will be strong winds , rain , rip currents and dangerous conditions at sea .

1	392	Hollywood will not easily recover from Harvey Weinstein -- not for a long time . 
1	392	 The hypocrisy level has hit Defcon 1 , 9.9 on the Richter scale . 
1	392	 Hollywood 's politics have always been a self - serving charade , a liberal masquerade for a rapacious and lubricious lifestyle . 
1	392	 But now , thanks to the Weinstein scandal , we see it more clearly than ever . 
1	392	 And it could n't be more repellent . ( 
1	392	 I had always thought Bill Clinton would have made the greatest studio executive of all time . 
1	392	 Now I 'm convinced of it . ) 
1	392	 If conservative investors had any courage , this would be the time to make a hostile takeover of the movie business . 
1	392	 Unfortunately , they do n't . 
1	392	 I know this from bitter personal experience . 
1	392	 Wealthy conservatives are delighted to support the Philharmonic , but when it comes to popular culture they turn away , as if afraid to get their hands dirty . 
1	392	 That this is a huge mistake should be obvious . 
1	392	 They have abandoned the culture -- and our children -- to the creepiest people imaginable . 
1	392	 What is going on in Hollywood is far from being just about Harvey . 
1	392	 It 's approaching a pandemic . 
1	392	" So many previously silent assaulted or raped women are coming out of the woodwork , it seems like a long - belated remake of "" Cheaper by the Dozen . "" "
1	392	 No one knows who will be next or if it will stop at Harvey . 
1	392	" The rot is everywhere , even , perhaps especially , in the precincts of "" high art . "" "

1	392	 Time to award her her greatest Oscar yet -- for playing someone deaf , dumb , and blind while living as a troglodyte in the Gobi desert . 
1	392	 Either the woman 's a liar or an utter nincompoop . 
1	392	 I 'll go with the former . 
1	392	 As for the great feminist George Clooney -- the first male star out of the box to condemn Weinstein 's behavior -- let 's give him the Nobel Prize in virtue signaling . 
1	392	 By coming forward , he was able to ace out his competition -- Howard Zinn - loving Matt Damon , who disgraced himself forever by covering up for Harvey a decade ago . ( 
1	392	" For those who may have missed it in the onslaught of sleazy details , Damon assured then New York Times reporter Sharon Waxman that Miramax 's high - paid Italian representative was a genuine "" creative film executive "" and not Harvey 's European procurer , as was , evidently correctly , rumored . "
1	392	" Damon is the same "" progressive "" movie star who makes films opposing school choice for the masses while living in a thirty million dollar house and sending his kids to private school . "

0	393	 Donald John Trump is an American businessman and politician who is President - elect of the United States as well as chairman and president of The Trump Organization Theresa May suggested she might further streamline visa application processes for Indians 
0	393	" Conservative MP Peter Bone said : "" What Donald Trump is tapping into is the deep frustration that people here have , that people come here illegally , commit crime and then ca n't be deported because of their human rights . "
0	393	" "" We also need to be robust in returning illegal immigrants . "" "
0	393	 One of the frustrating things is that when someone comes here and they break the law we seem to be powerless to deport them .

0	393	 Following Mr Trump 's win , Mexico has reiterated that it would not fund any wall . 
0	393	 A wave of protests continued yesterday afternoon in New York and Oakland in California as demonstrators took to the streets for the fifth consecutive day . 
0	393	 Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets since the results from Tuesday showed Mr Trump had secured enough votes in the 538-person electoral college to clinch the presidency . 
0	393	 In the main . 
0	393	 the protests have been peaceful and have decried Mr Trump for his campaign promises to clamp down on immigration and register Muslims along with claims the former reality TV star had sexually abused women . 
0	393	 So far , arrests have been in the dozens and a number of police have been injured . 
0	393	" Slogans including "" not my President "" and "" love trumps hate "" were chanted by campaigners on the march in New York , Los Angeles , Chicago and elsewhere . "
0	393	 Protesters say Mr Trump threatens their civil and human rights . 
0	393	 A protestor in New York holds a sign which reads , ' Trump is not my President ' 
0	393	 The protests come as it emerged that Hillary Clinton could receive two million more votes than Mr Trump when the final tally is made . 
0	393	 The latest findings show Democrat Mrs Clinton has received 400,000 more votes than the President - elect - 60.4 million compared with 60 million . 
0	393	 Millions of votes are yet to be counted in the pro - Democrat state of California and experts believe Mrs Clinton 's win of the popular vote could be extended to two million . 
0	393	 Campaigners are fighting for reform as they suggest the US electoral college system is outdated .

0	394	 Sheriff Joe Lombardo said the video shows some claims that Bennett made were not true , such as a gun being held to his head . 
0	394	 Lombardo said that while officers had a gun in hand while putting Bennett in cuffs , it was not directed at his head . 
0	394	" As for the claims officers said they would , "" blow his * * * * * * * head off , "" Lombardo reports his department found no evidence of that . "
0	394	 What Bennett says in his letter 
0	394	 Bennett wrote in his letter that he was visiting Las Vegas to watch the Mayweather - McGregor fight , and he was on the way to his hotel when he was detained . 
0	394	 According to Bennett 's statement , police ordered him to the ground at gunpoint , jammed a knee into his back and handcuffed him so tight that his fingers went numb .

0	394	" In his letter , Bennett called it an excessive use of force , simply because he was a "" black man in the wrong place at the wrong time . "" "

0	394	" "" I was n't doing nothing , man , "" Bennett is heard saying in the video . "" "
0	394	" They told us to get out and everybody ran . "" "
0	394	 Bennett 's attorney on the encounter 
0	394	 Bennett 's attorney , John Burris in Oakland , California , said he believed the TMZ 30-second video clip showed some of how his client was treated . 
0	394	" "" We think there was an unlawful detention and the use of excessive force , with a gun put to his head , "" Burris told The Associated Press . "" "
0	394	 He was just in the crowd . 
0	394	 He does n't drink or do drugs . 
0	394	 He was n't in a fight . 
0	394	 He was n't resisting . 
0	394	" He did nothing more or less than anyone in the crowd . "" "
0	394	 Burris said Bennett waited to make public his account of the incident until after Burris contacted Las Vegas police last week by letter and email , seeking police records of Bennett 's detention . 
0	394	 What NVMPD say about ' bias - based policing ' 
0	394	 In addition to explaining the events leading up to the encounter , police commented on social media commentary that the detention was motivated by race . 
0	394	" "" Many of the folks ... have called this an incident of biased - based policing … police officers focused solely on the race of an individual … I can tell you as I stand here today I see no evidence of that , "" said NVMPD Undersheriff Kevin McMahill . "
0	394	" "" In fact as you may have noticed , while officers were searching the casino they were able to evacuate many patrons of all races . "
0	394	" It 's also important for me to note to you both of the officers involved in this incident in question are of Hispanic origin , "" McMahill said . "
0	394	 McMahill invited Bennett and his legal team to make a formal statement to the officers . 
0	394	 According to McHill , after his detention , Bennett told officers that he understood the events that led to the incident . 
0	394	 He did mention to police that he had an issue with the officer who held a gun to his head . 
0	394	 In their second news conference , Lombardo commended the officers for following their training , and he called them heroic for running into a possible active shooter situation . 
0	394	 One of the officers involved in the incident did not have his body camera activated . 
0	394	 About Bennett as an advocate 
0	394	 Bennett is one of the 200 NFL players who did n't participate in the national anthem over the weekend in the wake of President Donald Trump suggesting the NFL bar players from kneeling in protest . 
0	394	 The entire Seahawks team also did n't participate during the anthem and sat out in the lockerroom before their game against the Tennessee Titans . 
0	394	 Over the last year , Bennett has been a leader of the national anthem protests started by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick . 
0	394	 Before President Trump 's comments on the NFL , Bennett gave this reason for his protesting : 
0	394	" "" I have always held the strong conviction that protesting or standing up for justice is just simply the right thing to do . "
0	394	" This fact is unequivocally , without question , why before every game , I sit during the national anthem - because equality does n't live in this country , and no matter how much money you make , what job title you have or have much you give , when you are seen as a ‘ n * * * * * , ' you will be treated that way . "" "
0	394	 Pete Carroll supports his players and Bennett . 
0	394	 At a news conference on Monday , Carroll told reporters he understands why people are upset with the protests , but he hopes that they listen . 
0	394	" "" It is not about denigration of the flag or our country , "" Carroll said . "" "
0	394	" We all can learn what we want to learn out of this , but I hope we learn about empathy . "" "

1	395	Only seven months into his puzzling presidency , Donald Trump has accomplished an odd achievement : He 's made Sigmund Freud relevant again . 
1	395	 Although the father of psychoanalysis is no longer fashionable , the Freudian concept of psychological projection is alive and well . 
1	395	" "" I think he 's crazy , "" said Sen. Jack Reed , a Rhode Island Democrat , speaking into an open microphone about Trump . "
1	395	" J. Brien Comey , father of fired FBI director Jim Comey , thinks Trump belongs "" in an institution . "" "
1	395	" Conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin has questioned the president 's "" mental stability . "" "
1	395	 These are n't isolated examples . 
1	395	 Many prominent liberals , conservatives , moderates , and libertarians have concluded that the president is off his rocker . 
1	395	 The tangible evidence for that proposition is thin , and Trump seems to be enjoying himself more and more . 
1	395	 Maybe we 're all just projecting . 
1	395	" "" Trump Derangement Syndrome "" is the phrase used by those sympathetic to the president to explain liberals ' hair - on - fire response to anything Trump says or does . "
1	395	 TDS is also an occupational hazard of being a member of the Republican establishment or a movement conservative who cares about such trite concepts as political principles . 
1	395	 This became clear again last week in the hysteria over Trump 's approach to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program . 
1	395	 In response to the administration 's original announcement rescinding DACA , liberals came unglued . 
1	395	" Not content to call the decision dumb and racist , which they did , they played the sanity card . "" "
1	395	" It is lunacy , "" opined Minnesota 's Democratic governor , Mark Dayton . "
1	395	" The president , added HBO comedic pundit John Oliver , is out of his mind . "" "
1	395	" Utter insanity , "" proclaimed Susan Hay , a co - founder of a Florida - based pro - immigrant and refugee nonprofit . "
1	395	 That was then . 
1	395	 A few days later , after dining on Chinese food ( you ca n't make this stuff up ) at the White House with Democratic congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer , Trump reversed field on DACA . 
1	395	 In the real world , such a development is called processing new information . 
1	395	 In modern U.S. politics , it 's considered treason -- or insanity . 
1	395	 This time , it was conservatives who melted down . 
1	395	" Ann Coulter pronounced it the death of the GOP brand ; Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King , an immigration hardliner , claimed it would "" crack "" Trump 's core base of support ; various commenters on conservative news sites theorized that Trump had been taken over by aliens . "
1	395	 Not the illegal kind , the kind from outer space . 
1	395	" Since before Trump 's inauguration , Democratic attorneys in the nation 's capital have contemplated replacing Trump under the 25th Amendment 's requirement that the president is able to "" discharge the powers and duties of his office , "" i.e. impeaching him on grounds he 's intellectually incapacitated . "
1	395	" Although this idea itself is bonkers , Coulter alluded to it — not unfavorably — Friday . "" "
1	395	" At this point , "" she tweeted , "" who DOESN'T want Trump impeached ? "" "
1	395	" Fellow conservative pundit Laura Ingraham , more measured in her criticism , noted that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough had spent most of the year speculating that Trump is "" mentally unstable [ but ] is praising him today . "" "
1	395	" Ordinary civilians are getting into the psychology racket , too . "" "
1	395	" Jody , "" an Arizona conservative who dialed in to Ingraham 's radio show , said she was suffering from a new strain of the disease : "" Pelosi Trump Schumer Disorder , "" she called it . "" "
1	395	" I am done if they do n't build the wall . "" "
1	395	 Jody was kidding , or at least half - kidding , but stressing out to this degree over politics is becoming a national obsession . 
1	395	 It ca n't be healthy . 
1	395	 And as for labeling as cuckoo those with whom we disagree , well , that 's an old KGB tactic . 
1	395	 We ca n't let Vladimir Putin do that to us . 
1	395	 Unfortunately , the psychology racket is full of those with no sense of history . 
1	395	" A new book arrived , unsolicited , in the mail recently with a long title : "" The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump : 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President . "" "
1	395	 The cover gives the game away , but the publisher also included a foreword from 91-year - old psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton , who offers the melodramatic view that clinicians who do n't warn the world about Donald Trump 's shortcomings are akin to Nazi doctors who worked at Auschwitz . 
1	395	 At the risk of practicing medicine without a license , I 'd suggest that this historical comparison is de facto evidence of TDS -- and paranoid grandiosity . 
1	395	" A better title would have been "" 27 Angry Democrats With Advanced Degrees Who Voted Against Trump and Say He 's Crazy Although They 've Never Met Him . "" "
1	395	" Lifton and others associated with this project are part of something called the "" Duty to Warn "" project . "
1	395	" The word "" duty "" is a term of art , given that since 1973 , the American Psychiatric Association had cautioned its members against diagnosing patients they 've not personally evaluated . "
1	395	 Although this seems like common sense , it 's more than that : It 's a hard - earned lesson . 
1	395	" It 's called the "" Goldwater Rule , "" and it comes from the 1964 presidential campaign . "
1	395	" In October of that year , when educated elites were just as unhinged over the idea of a Republican populist in the White House as they are today , provocative left - wing pamphleteer Ralph Ginzburg published an article in his "" Fact "" magazine with an incendiary headline : "" 1,189 Psychiatrists Say Goldwater Is Psychologically Unfit to Be President ! "" "
1	395	 For those too young to remember , Barry Goldwater was a conservative Arizona senator and the Republican Party 's 1964 presidential nominee . 
1	395	 Key in the creation of the U.S. Air Force Academy , Goldwater was also a decorated World War II pilot , a fiscal conservative , a fierce anti - communist , and friends in the Senate with John F. Kennedy . 
1	395	 As Donald Trump would do 52 years later , Goldwater wrested the GOP nomination away from the Establishment , creating a fissure in Republican politics that exists to this day . 
1	395	 Unlike Trump , Goldwater did not become president . 
1	395	 He lost to Lyndon Johnson in a historic landslide . 
1	395	 I 've never heard any political observer blame the Fact magazine article for that defeat , but it was so nasty and gratuitous that when the campaign was over Goldwater filed a libel suit in federal court . 
1	395	 Of the 12,356 psychiatrists queried by Ginzburg , 2,417 responded - and only 657 pronounced Goldwater psychologically fit to be president . 
1	395	" Some 1,189 of these quacks diagnosed the senator -- on the record , with their names attached - as unfit , offering such dubious diagnoses as "" megalomania , "" "" paranoid personality , "" emotionally unstable , "" "" immature , "" "" grossly psychotic , "" "" mass murderer , "" "" immoral , "" "" chronic schizophrenic , "" "" dangerous lunatic "" and - stupidest of all -- "" cowardly . "" "
1	395	 Goldwater won his case , despite the high bar public officials face in such matters . 
1	395	 When he testified in federal court , he came across as rational , composed , normal , and emotionally healthy . 
1	395	 His critics were the ones who were unhinged . 
1	395	 Is that happening again ? 
1	395	 Donald Trump seemed almost happy last week . 
1	395	 Sure , he wants good coverage in the New York Times . 
1	395	 Does n't everyone ? 
1	395	 And , yes , he 'd rather spend time with Chuck Schumer than Mitch McConnell . 
1	395	 Who would n't ? 
1	395	" He wants to build a wall to prevent future waves of illegal immigration , but has a soft spot for "" Dreamers . "" "
1	395	 He was in his element comforting hurricane victims . 
1	395	 These traits make him crazy ? 
1	395	 He could be the sanest politician in Washington right now .

0	400	Chris Brown , 27 , was stopped from a potential physical altercation by police at a charity basketball game on the anniversary of 9/11 ( video below ) . 
0	400	 The singer got into such a heated argument with someone in the stands that the cops were called in to intervene before the situation escalated any further . 
0	400	 The incident occurred at the Power 106 Celebrity Basketball Game at USC , reports TMZ . 
0	400	 Video footage shows Brown becoming visibly upset as he leans over the bench seats to argue with a spectator . 
0	400	" The music was too loud to make out exactly what words were exchanged , but USC cops can be heard saying , "" I do n't care who 's here , get it straight . "" "
0	400	 Brown walked away twice but came back moments later each time to continue the quarrel , according to the Daily Mail . 
0	400	 At one point , the R&B singer was encircled by cops as he tried to explain the situation . 
0	400	 Brown has become the latest high - profile star to join Colin Kaepernick 's national anthem protest against police brutality and racial inequality in America . 
0	400	 Before the basketball game , Brown did not observe the anthem .

0	401	 This morning Walt Disney World opened its gates to all four theme parks to guests . 
0	401	 Even though the parks looked immaculate , several attractions were closed today ( or delayed ) due to debris caused by Hurricane Irma . 
0	401	 We walked around Magic Kingdom to see if we could identify the causes behind these delays . 
0	401	 Walt Disney World Railroad has trees down across the tracks . 
0	401	 Tom Sawyer Island is also currently closed due to Hurricane Irma 's after effects . 
0	401	 Jungle Cruise has also been reported as needing at least a week to remove the debris before it can be operational .

0	401	 Overall it seems that Walt Disney World had relatively minimal damage and the lights remain on . 
0	401	 Disney World is still advising their resort guests to remain in their room / building and will notify everyone once the curfew is lifted .

1	402	Trump just decertified the Iran deal , and , oh well , it was nice thinking about peace while we had the chance . 
1	402	 True , Trump has n't actually repealed the deal . 
1	402	" He announced new sanctions , according to ABC News , "" but did n't do anything that would alter the Obama - era deal that he has denounced since his presidential campaign . "" "
1	402	 Decertification is Trump to a T : you do n't accomplish anything , but you manage to create the shittiest possible situation regardless . 
1	402	 It 's a real gift . 
1	402	 The deal , Trump said , is no longer in the national security interest of the United States . 
1	402	" This decision , which has been referred as "" decertification , "" is a shift in official position . "
1	402	 It is a significant declaration that leaves the nuclear agreement in place , but puts Congress in charge of whether or not to follow up with action — triggering a 60-day window for lawmakers to re - impose sanctions against Iran that were suspended in 2015 as part of the agreement . 
1	402	 Trump decertified the Iran deal just ‘ cause , why not , since you 're gutting Obamacare and deciding to let Puerto Rico dehydrate ; Trump decided to decertify the Iran deal because you 're well on your way to becoming the Worst President of Every Timeline , yeah baby , and why not light another Roman candle on the fast roller coaster down to geohell ? 
1	402	 Maybe Congress will rescue the deal , maybe not . 
1	402	" The important thing is that this takes the best hope we have with Iran and wades back into David Frum 's "" Let 's Invent , and then Invade , the Axis of Evil , "" which gave us the tragedy of Iraq . "
1	402	 That worked so well , why not repeat it again ? 
1	402	 The President said : 
1	402	" "" As I have said many times , the Iran Deal was one of the worst and one sided transactions the United States has ever entered into "" "
1	402	 What does he think we can get instead ? 
1	402	" The President thinks that Iran has sponsored terrorism ( and the Saudis have n't ) and that the Iranian regime "" has committed multiple violations of the agreement "" ( there are mechanisms to deal with these ) . "
1	402	 Trump called on the intelligence community to look at Iran 's help to the North Korean nuclear program . 
1	402	 Oh ! 
1	402	 I can help with that one ! 
1	402	 There 's a base right south of Camp Fantasy , in the northernmost region of the Your Brain is No Longer Functioning Mountain Region . 
1	402	" The President says Iran loves the chants "" Death to America "" and "" Death to Israel , "" because the President and his team of wannabe - Iranian bombers do n't see Iran or its eighty million people — they see whatever Islamophobic , racist - ass caricatures get cooked up on Fox News , where Khomeini is still somehow alive in the year 2017 . "
1	402	 Trump decertified the deal , because nothing , not even human life or world peace , is more important than repudiating every bit of Obama 's legacy . 
1	402	 The major powers and American struck a deal with Iran in July 2015 . 
1	402	 It eased sanctions and got real monitoring of Iran 's nuclear program . 
1	402	 Trump 's own Defense Secretary said Iran has complied . 
1	402	 The agreement got everything we needed from the regime , and now Trump wants out , because the movie in his head tells him being the leading asshole of the world is definitely , assuredly the best way to go . 
1	402	 Trump decertified the Iran deal because he thinks he can get a better one , this man who ca n't pass a single piece of legislation and ca n't manage to avoid staring at an eclipse . 
1	402	 Trump decertified the Iran deal because he does n't care . 
1	402	 Trump decertified the Iran deal because it does n't matter who the Commander - in - Chief is ; there is a National Security blob in Washington that no single President can ever fight , and it consumes money and spits out drones and missiles . 
1	402	 Trump is incompetent in a million unusual ways , but he 's particularly , peculiarly incompetent in resisting the mechanisms of institutional influence . 
1	402	 In other words , Trump will believe whatever the good people of the military - industrial concept whisper in his ear . 
1	402	 That community kicked it around , and decided it was best that we threaten Iran again . 
1	402	 After all , the NatSec blob has never forgotten or forgiven Iran for rejecting Western hegemony — and anyway , none of their own sons or daughters got shot in Iraq , so yes , why not set the stage for an eventual war with Iran ? 
1	402	 Trump decertified the deal , and the people of the world were not surprised at all . 
1	402	 The man is barely part of reality . 
1	402	 What did we expect ?Trump Decertified the Iranian Deal , Just 'Cause
0	403	Emails leaked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta 's private email account Friday by WikiLeaks addressed using executive privilege to keep the emails between Hillary Clinton and President Obama from being released , a 2008 survey testing reaction to then - Sen . 
0	403	" Obama 's Muslim father and use of cocaine , and a suggestion from former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm on how to take Clinton out of the "" bubble . "" "
0	403	 March 2015 : Podesta wrote to Cheryl Mills about withholding emails between Clinton and Obama 
0	403	" Six days before Hillary Clinton spoke to reporters at the United Nations about her private email server , Podesta wrote to Cheryl Mills , "" Think we should hold emails to and from potus ? "
0	403	 That 's the heart of his exec privilege . 
0	403	 We could get them to ask for that . 
0	403	" They may not care , but I seems like they will . "" "
0	403	" In September , Politico reported that the State Department would not release emails exchanged between Clinton and Obama to the public , citing the "" presidential communications privilege , "" which is another name for the executive privilege . "
0	403	 Claiming the privilege enables the president to withhold certain information that has been requested by other branches of government or by the public . 
0	403	 This means that the emails the two wrote to each other wo n't be released until 5 to 12 years after the end of the Obama administration , as dictated by the Presidential Records Act . 
0	403	 January 2008 : Clinton pollster proposed message testing lines on Obama -- including reference to his Muslim father , past cocaine use

0	403	 Obama . 
0	403	 Kristi Fuksa , of Greenberg Research , sent the email to Democratic operatives including Podesta , Paul Begala , Tara McGuinness and Susan McCue 
0	403	" The statements floated included subjects like his upbringing among Muslims , his father 's Muslim faith , his referring to past cocaine use as "" a little blow "" -- here 's the survey : "
0	403	 * 1 Obama ( owe - BAHM - uh ) was the only candidate at a recent event not to cover his heart during the national anthem and he has stopped wearing an American flag pin . 
0	403	 * 2 Obama ( owe - BAHM - uh ) benefited from a land deal from a contributor who has been indicted for corruption . 
0	403	 * 3 Obama ( owe - BAHM - uh ) would personally negotiate with the leaders of terrorist nations like Iran and North Korea without preconditions . 
0	403	 * 4 Obama ( owe - BAHM - uh ) voted against allowing people to use handguns to defend themselves against intruders . 
0	403	 * 5 Obama ( owe - BAHM - uh ) plans to raise taxes by 180 ( one hundred and eighty ) billion dollars a year to pay for his government - run health care plan 
0	403	 * 6 Obama ( owe - BAHM - uh ) voted repeatedly against emergency funding bills for U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
0	403	 * 7 Obama ( owe - BAHM - uh)‘s father was a Muslim and Obama grew up among Muslims in the world 's most populous Islamic country . 
0	403	 * 8 Obama ( owe - BAHM - uh ) is ranked as one of the ten most liberal members of the Senate because of his support of issues like gay adoption . 
0	403	 * 9 ( Other )

0	403	 * 11 ( None )

0	403	" * 15 Obama ( owe - BAHM - uh ) described his former use of cocaine as using "" a little blow . "" "
0	403	" Begala told the Washington Post that the survey was named for John McCain because "" it was designed to test attacks that might come in the general election . "" "
0	403	" He also pointed out that "" every campaign and every PAC tests potential negatives against the candidate they support ... that 's all it was . "" "

1	404	"According to the latest damning snippet from Michael Wolff 's Fire and Fury , President Donald Trump tried to "" rationalize "" why people would join the KKK . "
1	404	 From the New York Times review : 
1	404	 There are lots of arresting details in the book . 
1	404	" We learn that the administration holds special animus for what it calls "" D.O.J. women , "" or women who work in the Justice Department . "
1	404	" Wolff writes that after the white supremacist mayhem in Charlottesville , Va. , Trump privately rationalized "" why someone would be a member of the K.K.K. "" "
1	404	 Many believe the anecdotes and quotes from Wolff 's book should be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism , but this one is not implausible . 
1	404	" Trump went on the record in the wake of the Charlottesville white supremacy march that left Heather Heyer dead , saying he believed there were "" good people "" on both sides of the protest , one side of which was rife with Neo - Nazis and white supremacists . "
1	404	 Trump was widely criticized for the response , which many considered a tacit endorsement of white supremacy . 
1	404	 During his presidential campaign , an old New York Times story was unearthed that reported Trump 's father , Fred , back in 1927 , was arrested at a rally in 1927 where KKK members were present .

1	405	 We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it . 
1	405	 Power is not a means ; it is an end .  
1	405	 Have you ever had one of those days when you swear that you are actually being secretly taped for some sort of bad internet prank show ? 
1	405	 One of the best examples for me was when James Comey , then - director of the FBI , laid out the most impressive case against Hillary Clinton for illegal handling of classified information but then basically told the world , April Fools ! 
1	405	 I actually looked around my room to see if I was being filmed . 
1	405	 I occasionally have the same experience when I read stories about liberalism and how they support the Constitution through totalitarian values . 
1	405	 I found myself in that same situation this morning after reading about the new procedures for the police in Seattle , Washington . 
1	405	 It all started when three outstanding young community members attempted to rob a 7-Eleven in downtown Seattle — a 17-year - old woman and two 19-year - old men . 
1	405	 A police officer who was nearby immediately engaged with one of the men in a ground fight . 
1	405	 During this fight , he was hit over the head with a bottle by the 17-year - old . 
1	405	 One of the 19-year olds then ran into a building , where he engaged in a firefight with the police . 
1	405	 During this exchange , one of the officers was shot in the face and ribs . 
1	405	 Another officer was shot in the chest , but luckily she was wearing a protective vest . 
1	405	 Yet another officer had his hand grazed by a bullet . 
1	405	 The young community member who was shooting at the police was eventually killed in the gunfight , and the other two community members were apprehended without further injury . 
1	405	 So , what about this is so surreal ? 
1	405	 While horrific and sad , nothing in this story thus far challenges our current view of the world . 
1	405	 That is unfortunate in its truth , but what bothers me more is how the police are now being required to report upon these incidents . 
1	405	 Instead of stating the truth — that these individuals are suspects in a crime ( until they are tried in court and judged to be guilty , they are still innocent , no matter how obvious or horrendous the crime)—the police are now being told they are to refer to them as community members . 
1	405	 I wrote recently about this very phenomenon . 
1	405	 If the left can not ignore the horrific nature of crime , they will simply relabel it so as not to offend those who are affected by the consequences . 
1	405	 Well , that is not entirely true . 
1	405	 There are those whom the left will not concern itself with . 
1	405	 The victim of the crime will clearly be affected by this event . 
1	405	 I am certain that they will carry with them a new sense of fear for the rest of their lives . 
1	405	 The officers who were shot will also be affected forever as well , both mentally and physically . 
1	405	 Being shot at is a significant event ; I can only imagine that being shot magnifies this factor exponentially . 
1	405	 Not only will the officers shot have their lives changed , but think of their families and especially their children . 
1	405	 Every day they will wonder if that is the last time they will see their mother or father . 
1	405	 Yet the left does not view any of them worthy of their guardianship . 
1	405	 No compatible source was found for this video . 
1	405	 As always , liberals will attempt to take responsibility away from the perpetrators of crime and throw that accountability onto society itself ( often by blaming the victim ) . 
1	405	 Since the crime itself can not be questioned , they will instead change the verbiage so as to misconstrue the true depth . 
1	405	 These scums are n't suspects at all , they are simply community members . 
1	405	 No different from you or me in any way that matters or is worthy of note . 
1	405	 This is the essence of Newspeak , which George Orwell wrote of in his book 1984 . 
1	405	 If you want to control the minds of the people , simply choose the words that they can use . 
1	405	 Once you lack the words to describe something , then that event or emotion can not exist . 
1	405	 Here we can see that very occurrence in real life . 
1	405	 Forget about the victims or the police . 
1	405	 Forget about those affected by causality . 
1	405	 They are simply the collateral damage caused by society failing . 
1	405	 There is no personal responsibility — only responsibility of society . 
1	405	 Therefore , there is no individual control . 
1	405	 This is why the left is so vehemently opposed to any sort of label that makes an individual take responsibility for themselves . 
1	405	 To do so leaves them powerless and voids their control . 
1	405	" In the book 1984 , the hero makes a very astute statement : "" Confession is not betrayal . "
1	405	 What you say or do does n't matter ; only feelings matter . 
1	405	" If they could make me stop loving you — that would be the real betrayal . "" "
1	405	 This fact is not lost by liberals . 
1	405	 Simply forcing someone to conform is not enough . 
1	405	 Making someone say what you want does not change their beliefs or values . 
1	405	 Instead , manipulate their ability to formulate thoughts through limitation of the language . 
1	405	 I will close with this quote from the same book , which I feel sums up my view of progressives completely . 
1	405	 The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake . 
1	405	 We are not interested in the good of others ; we are interested solely in power , pure power … We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing . 
1	405	 All the others … never had the courage to recognize their own motives . 
1	405	 They pretended , perhaps they even believed , that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time , and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal . 
1	405	 We are not like that . 
1	405	 We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it . 
1	405	 Power is not a means ; it is an end . 
1	405	 One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution ; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship . 
1	405	 The object of persecution is persecution . 
1	405	 The object of torture is torture . 
1	405	 The object of power is power . 
1	405	 Now you begin to understand me .Police in Seattle Ca n't Say ‘ Suspect ' Anymore , It 's Now ‘ Community Members '

1	407	 If you recall , then - presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was one that was always talking about money in politics while hypocritically soliciting donations from some of the world 's most corrupt people and organizations . 
1	407	 Now , it 's come to light that Clinton apparently funneled over $ 800,000 from her campaign money to her new political PAC , Onward Together , which is backing several groups of resistance against the current administration , including ANTIFA . 
1	407	 The Daily Caller reports : 
1	407	" As a presidential candidate , Clinton railed against "" dark money "" groups like Onward Together . "
1	407	 Clinton transferred$800,000 from her failed 2016 presidential campaign to Onward Together shortly before announcing the group 's launch in May , documents the campaign filed with the FEC reveal . 
1	407	 Clinton does n't even deny that she is supporting such groups . 
1	407	" In an email signed by her that went out last week asking for money , Clinton wrote , "" You may not have heard much about the work we 're doing at Onward Together , "" Clinton wrote . "" "
1	407	 That 's because we 're working behind the scene to fund , support , and amplify the work of the groups we 're supporting . 
1	407	" We 're not the story : they are . "" "

1	407	" "" Onward Together has not given any financial support to us , "" Helen Kalla , an Indivisible spokesperson , wrote in an email . "
1	407	" Kalla added that Clinton 's group has "" been amplifying and highlighting our work through their digital networks , "" which she explained has consisted of "" retweeting [ Indivisible ] , and they 've highlighted our work via their emails to their list too . "" "
1	407	" Onward Together is not required to reveal donors ' identity as a 501(c)4 "" social welfare "" organization . "
1	407	 The group also will not be revealing those identities , something that is only occurring to protect the guilty . 
1	407	 Meanwhile , because the Trump administration did not keep its promise to investigate and seek prosecution of Mrs. Clinton , she is freely promoting her blame book , What Happened , and now she is funding the little Communists known as ANTIFA , which are working against the administration and against the very heart and soul of American culture and history . 
1	407	 But we ca n't do anything about the Clintons because they are really good people , right Mr. President ?

0	410	Former Dems Now Backing Trump : ' Our Country 's Going in the Wrong Direction ' 
0	410	" Donald Trump joined Bill O'Reilly on "" The Factor "" tonight to discuss a wide range of topics , including his claims that the election is rigged against him . "
0	410	" "" The system is rigged , "" Trump said , arguing that the media has been "" horrible "" in their coverage of him , while giving Hillary Clinton a pass for her various scandals . "
0	410	 He added that Clinton was also given a pass by the Justice Department and the FBI for her private email server and mishandling of state secrets . 
0	410	" "" She is so guilty in so many different ways that she should n't even be allowed to run for president , "" Trump stated . "" "
0	410	" So right there , the system is really rigged . "" "
0	410	 The Republican nominee added that he also is n't ruling out the possibility of widespread election fraud , with votes being miscounted at locations around the country . 
0	410	" O'Reilly pointed out that there are n't any "" hard facts "" to back up such allegations . "
0	410	" "" On a mass level ... 120 million American votes ... the thing 's going to be dishonest ? "
0	410	" Do you believe that ? "" "

0	411	John Fox 's decision to play for overtime in the Denver Broncos ' double - overtime loss to the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday was hard to make sense of when it happened . 
0	411	 The decision is n't looking any better as time passes . 
0	411	 Following Jacoby Jones ' stunning 70-yard touchdown reception that tied the score late in regulation , Fox called for Peyton Manning to kneel on the football with 31 seconds to play . 
0	411	 As the Atlanta Falcons proved one day later , getting into field - goal range is n't always so much about time as it is execution . 
0	411	 In theory , the Broncos hired Manning for just such a moment , and the quarterback had the weapons to quickly move downfield . 
0	411	 Instead , Fox chose to put his legendary quarterback on ice . 
0	411	 Fox explained his thought process Monday . 
0	411	" "" ( The Jones touchdown ) was pretty devastating , "" Fox explained , via the Broncos ' official Twitter . "" "
0	411	" It just did n't seem the right time ... to go for the jugular . "" "
0	411	 Fox added in his news comference that he would call for a kneel - down 10 times out of 10 in the same situation , via Lindsay Jones of USA TODAY Sports . 
0	411	" Broncos CEO John Elway backed his coach , saying he thought it was a "" good move "" to regroup and move to overtime . "
0	411	 Jones reported that Elway avoided the question if he would have wanted to take a shot if he was the quarterback . 
0	411	" The "" jugular "" reference sticks with us the most . "
0	411	 If there is ever a time to get aggressive , to go for the jugular , is n't it in the playoffs with everything on the line ? 
0	411	 Fox coached scared and might have ended up on the wrong side of an instant classic because of it .John Fox preferred Denver Broncos going for overtime

0	412	 Trump has even joined in on the fun in the past while acting as a host . 
0	412	 On Saturday 's broadcast of the show , the actors took on the second debate between Trump and Clinton , and the GOP nominee was the focus of some pointed satire from Baldwin .

0	413	Officials familiar with the situation say that NATO has agreed to join the US - led anti - ISIS coalition on an alliance level , with indications that Germany and France were the last nations to agree to the formal move , which will be announced during the Brussels summit . 
0	413	" All NATO members are already individually members of the anti - ISIS coalition , and diplomats say that the move will have no actual consequence , and seemingly is being done just for the sake of a "" purely symbolic "" gesture during President Trump 's visit . "
0	413	" President Trump has always been keen to bring NATO deeper into the ISIS war , of course , and has made a big deal about NATO 's obsolescence because it was n't formed specifically to deal with terrorism , claiming in April that "" back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism . "" "

1	414	A note to Steve Bannon : No matter what your beliefs are , the most dangerous thing you can do is cross Donald Trump . 
1	414	" The fallout against the former White House political strategist and Trump confidant is continuing this week , in the wake of his comments appearing in Michael Wolff 's tell - all book , "" Fire and Fury , "" and as his political foes are celebrating his perceived demise and his political friends are starting to distance themselves from him . "
1	414	 One of Bannon 's strongest allies — the Mercer family , which is funding Breitbart — issued a stinging rebuke on Thursday , but limited the scope of their attack to what Bannon said about the president . 
1	414	" "" I support President Trump and the platform upon which he was elected , "" Rebekah Mercer told the Washington Post . "" "
1	414	" My family and I have not communicated with Steve Bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his political agenda , nor do we support his recent actions and statements . "" "
1	414	" And CBS reported Friday that Mercer "" cut all ties "" with Bannon because that 's what Trump wanted her to do . "
1	414	 . 
1	414	 @CBSNews confirms Steve Bannon 's longtime benefactor Rebekah Mercer cut * all ties * with him at the request of White House officials in the aftermath of # FireAndFury .

1	414	 But Mercer is continuing to finance Breitbart , which has not only been Bannon 's political agenda , it 's been his political essence . 
1	414	 Bannon made Roy Moore his candidate in the Alabama special election . 
1	414	 When Moore 's major flaws were exposed , Bannon dispatched Breitbart 's staffers to attack the women who accused Moore of trying to date them when they were teenagers . 
1	414	 After the election , Breitbart 's editor admitted that they were acting as political operatives in their decision to cover the election . 
1	414	 So while Breitbart 's funders are wondering whether or not to cut ties with Steve Bannon , it 's important to realize that Bannon 's legacy will certainly live on .

0	415	With the end of his second term on the horizon , President Obama spoke to 60 Minutes this week , reflecting on his achievements -- and on the problems not yet solved . 
0	415	 At the top of that list is the protracted crisis in Syria , where more than 250,000 people have died , according to UN reports , and some 12 million have been forced from their homes . 
0	415	" Correspondent Steve Kroft asks President Obama about the lack of progress in Syria , but Obama says improvement takes time . "" "
0	415	" In a situation that is as volatile and with as many players as there are inside of Syria , there are n't any silver bullets , "" he says . "
0	415	 One of those players , Kroft points out , is Russia , which recently stepped up airstrikes and naval bombardments in support of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad . 
0	415	" President Putin "" is challenging your leadership , Mr. President , "" Kroft says . "
0	415	" Obama disagrees . "" "
0	415	" Steve , I 've got to tell you , if you think that running your economy into the ground and having to send troops in in order to prop up your only ally , is leadership , then we 've got a different definition of leadership , "" he says . "
0	415	 Kroft and Obama discuss domestic issues as well , including gun violence . 
0	415	 At a press conference after last week 's mass shooting in Roseburg , Oregon , Obama urged the country to do more to prevent these tragedies . 
0	415	 In the unaired clip below , Kroft asks the president if he can personally make a difference . 
0	415	 Obama acknowledges that his options are limited . 
0	415	" "" We are running out of administrative actions that could really move the needle in reducing gun violence in this country , "" he says . "
0	415	" At the same time , he adds , "" it is not realistic to think that this Congress will pass any common sense gun safety legislation . "" "
0	415	" But that does n't mean a public outcry ca n't effect change , Obama says . "" "
0	415	" The most important thing I can do right now is just to keep on lifting up the issue and saying , ' It does n't have to be this way , ' "" he tells Kroft . "" "
0	415	" I genuinely believe that . "" "
0	415	 The two - part interview also touches on the 2016 presidential race , and the candidates on both sides of the aisle . 
0	415	" Kroft asks the president what he thinks of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump . "" "
0	415	" He is , you know , the classic reality TV character , "" Obama says . "" "
0	415	" At these early stages , it 's not surprising that he 's gotten a lot of attention . "" "
0	415	" As to whether that attention will evaporate , the president declines to speculate . "" "
0	415	" I 'll leave it up to the pundits to make that determination , "" Obama says . "" "
0	415	" I do n't think he 'll end up being president of the United States . "" "
0	415	 At different moments in the interview , the president turns reflective , taking stock of his time in office and eyeing the year ahead . 
0	415	 In the unaired clip below , he tells Kroft that , at this point , he 's learned to trust his instincts . 
0	415	" "" The nice thing about being a veteran in anything is your fear kind of goes away , "" he says . "" "
0	415	" There 's no doubt I 'm better at this job now than I was when I started . "" "
0	415	 At the end of the interview , Kroft asks Obama if he 's glad he ca n't run for president again . 
0	415	" Obama says he feels a mixture of satisfaction at what he 's accomplished and a desire to still do more . "" "
0	415	" But by the time I 'm finished , I think it will be time for me to go , "" he says , adding that new blood in the White House is essential for a healthy democracy . "
0	415	" "" Do you think if you ran again , could run again , and did run again , you would be elected ? "" "

0	416	 Katie Freeman , 44 , was given a prosthetic nose , fake teeth and darkened skin as she filmed My Week As A Muslim . 
0	416	 The show documents Ms Freeman 's experiences in Manchester in the week after a terror attack at the city 's arena that killed 22 people . 
0	416	" Described as an attempt to challenge stereotypes , the show aimed to give the the 44-year - old a "" chance to meaningfully walk in the shoes of someone from a different background . "" "
0	416	 Katie Freeman starred in the documentary ( Channel 4 ) 
0	416	 However , when a trailer for the show aired on Tuesday , viewers took to social media to slam the nature of Ms Freeman 's disguise . 
0	416	" One wrote : "" What the f * * * is this ? "
0	416	 Channel 4 has totally missed the mark here . 
0	416	 Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to put prosthetics on somebody to make them a caricature of people of a different race ( as if being white and Muslim are exclusive anyway ) ? 
0	416	 On primetime TV in 2017 ? 
0	416	" Madness . "" "
0	416	" Another bemused commenter simply wrote : "" Did they ... brownface her ? "" "
0	416	" On Twitter , viewer Alice Beggs said : "" Just saw Channel 4 have a show called ' My Week As A Muslim ' where this white woman has brownface and prosthetics so she can learn about racism etc . "
0	416	" Because god forbid we just listen to Muslims when they tell us what abuse they get . "" "
0	416	" Another criticised Channel 4 for not "" actually following a Muslim poc ( person of colour ) and documenting their life , instead of doing this "" . "
0	416	" Before Ms Freeman underwent the transformation , she admitted she would avoid sitting next to a Muslim on public transport because "" you see them and think they 're going to blow something up "" , the Daily Mail reported . "
0	416	 She later said she was shocked by the level of abuse she suffered in the course of the programme . 
0	416	" During one incident in which someone shouted "" f * * * * * * Muslims , in this town ? "" "
0	416	 as she walked past her local pub . 
0	416	 Ms Freeman lived with Saima Alvi , a Muslim woman , during filming for the show . 
0	416	 The 49-year - old told of the abuse she suffers regularly . 
0	416	" She said : "" It 's very humiliating that I am pigeon - holed or put in the same box as a terrorist . "
0	416	" "" What I have learnt is that there are genuinely nice people who are unfortunately misled about Islam . "" "
0	416	" Speaking to the Daily Mail , Fiyaz Mughal , founder of community cohesion group Faith Matters , said : "" This is trying to drive ratings by racial stereotyping . "
0	416	 Channel 4 needs to apologise . 
0	416	" "" If you are trying to bridge divides , what message does it send to Muslim communities that people think of you in a certain way ? "
0	416	" That certain crude facial characteristics are what defines you as Asian ? "" "
0	416	" The show 's executive producer , Fozia Khan , defended the programme , told the Daily Mail : "" The programme allowed Katie to meaningfully walk in the shoes of someone from a different background and to experience what it is like to be a part of the British Pakistani Muslim community rather than just observe as an outsider .

0	417	 OKLAHOMA CITY ( KOKH ) — 
0	417	 An Oklahoma man has been arrested after attempting to detonate a vehicle bomb parked outside a downtown Oklahoma City bank . 
0	417	 Jerry Drake Varnell , of Sayre , was arrested August 12 in Oklahoma City . 
0	417	 Court documents show that at 1 a.m. 23-year - old Varnell attempted to detonate what he believed was a van loaded with explosives parked in an alley next to BancFirst , 101 N. Broadway . 
0	417	" Court documents show that the FBI learned of Varnell 's plot in December 2016 after being notified by a confidential informant of his plot to "" bomb the Federal Reserve Building in Washington D.C. in a manner similar to the Oklahoma City Bombing . "" "
0	417	 The informant later told Varnell that they had access to anhydrous ammonia and ammonium nitrate . 
0	417	 The two then began collecting items to develop an explosive device . 
0	417	" In May 2017 , Varnell allegedly told the informant he wanted to target BancFirst in downtown Oklahoma City instead because "" I do n't wanna kill a bunch of people "" . "
0	417	" Court records show that Varnell admitted to "" holding 3 percent ideology "" during a meeting with the informant . "
0	417	" "" Varnell expressed a desire to start the new revolution . "
0	417	" His targets included institutions with affiliation to the U.S. Government in Washington D.C. "" FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Raul Bujanda said . "
0	417	 The DOJ reports that Varnell continued to advance his plans to build a device and had a statement ready to be posted to social media following the explosion . 
0	417	 On August 11 , Varnell met with an undercover FBI employee that was posing as the supplier of the anhydrous ammonia . 
0	417	 The two then drove to a mini - storage unit in El Reno and began constructing the device .

1	418	 Donald Trump continued his campaign of incendiary statements over the weekend , threatening to launch a war with North Korea that could unleash a nuclear catastrophe . 
1	418	" On Saturday afternoon , the US president tweeted that past administrations "" have been talking to North Korea for 25 years . "" "
1	418	" This "" has n't worked , "" he wrote , adding : "" Sorry , but only one thing will work ! "" "
1	418	" Asked later to elaborate on what he meant , Trump replied , "" You 'll figure that out pretty soon . "" "
1	418	" These threats came three weeks after Trump 's tirade at the United Nations General Assembly September 19 , when he declared that the US was "" ready , willing , and able "" to "" totally destroy "" North Korea , a country of 25 million people . "
1	418	 Four days later , Trump threatened to assassinate the North Korean leader . 
1	418	" If the North Korean foreign minister 's speech at the UN "" echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man [ Kim Jong - Un ] , "" Trump wrote , "" they wo n't be around much longer ! "" "
1	418	 On Thursday , Trump organized a White House dinner with US military leaders , which had all the hallmarks of a meeting of a war cabinet . 
1	418	" During a photo op before the dinner , Trump , surrounded by generals in military uniform , likened the moment to "" the calm before the storm . "" "
1	418	" Asked what storm he was talking about , Trump would only say , "" You 'll find out soon . "" "
1	418	 To the extent that Trump 's words are interpreted as a genuine expression of the policy and plans of the United States government , the inescapable conclusion is that the world stands on the brink of the most devastating military conflict since the outbreak of World War II . 
1	418	" Were language and reality in correct political alignment , the present situation would be described officially as an "" Imminent danger of war . "" "
1	418	" Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee , embroiled in a political conflict with Trump , warned that the president 's reckless threats were leading the United States "" on the path to World War III . "" "
1	418	 But despite Corker 's statement on Sunday , there is , within the ruling elite and its media , a staggering disconnect between consciousness and reality . 
1	418	 The public declarations emanating from the White House are being reported by the media as if they will have no consequences . 
1	418	 The thinking seems to be that Trump does n't mean what he says . 
1	418	 The consequences of a war would prove to be so catastrophic that Trump is simply bluffing . 
1	418	 But what if he is n't ? 
1	418	 What if the North Korean government takes the threats of the American president , as it must , seriously ? 
1	418	 With Trump having publicly declared that he will destroy North Korea and that the doomsday hour is fast approaching , how will the Pyongyang government interpret American military actions near the borders of its country ? 
1	418	 With only minutes to make a decision , will the regime view the approach of a US bomber toward North Korean airspace as the beginning of a full - scale attack ? 
1	418	 Will it conclude that it has no choice but to assume the worst and initiate a military strike against South Korea ? 
1	418	 Will it fire missiles , as it has threatened , in the direction of Japan , Guam , Australia , or even the United States ? 
1	418	 From a purely legal standpoint , North Korea can claim , in light of Trump 's threats , that such action on its part would be an act of self - defense , a legitimate response to an imminent military threat . 
1	418	 Aside from the calculations of Pyongyang , one must assume that the regimes in Beijing and Moscow are also looking at the unfolding developments with increasing alarm . 
1	418	 While the American media , as is its wo nt , responds complacently and thoughtlessly to Trump 's threats , the Chinese regime can not avoid viewing them with deadly seriousness . 
1	418	 Trump is , after all , the commander in chief of the American military . 
1	418	 He has the power -- which Congress has shown no interest in challenging -- to order military actions . 
1	418	 A US attack on North Korea would pose an overwhelming threat to China . 
1	418	 As in 1950 , a war against North Korea would -- even if it did not rapidly escalate into a nuclear exchange -- lead inexorably to an American incursion across the 38th Parallel . 
1	418	 The last time the US military crossed the border into North Korea , the Chinese responded with a massive military counterattack . 
1	418	 There is no reason to believe that the present - day regime in Beijing would remain passive in the face of a new US invasion of North Korea . 
1	418	 It would view an American invasion as an unacceptable violation of a geopolitical arrangement on the Korean peninsula that has been in existence for nearly 65 years . 
1	418	 Beijing 's reaction would be influenced by the already tense conditions that exist in the Asia - Pacific region . 
1	418	" For years , the US has been systematically building up its military forces in the South China Sea under the "" Pivot to Asia "" initiated by the Obama administration . "
1	418	 The purpose has been to militarily encircle China , which dominant sections of the ruling class consider the major competitor to US interests . 
1	418	 Over the weekend , China 's main regional competitor , Japan , declared that it fully backed Trump 's threats against North Korea . 
1	418	 Thus , the outbreak of war between North Korea and the United States would inevitably involve China , which , in turn , would draw all of Asia , as well as Australia , into the bloody maelstrom . 
1	418	 Nor would it be possible for Europe and Latin America , which have their own interests in Asia , to stand aside . 
1	418	 Little has appeared in the American media about the consequences of war with North Korea . 
1	418	 An article in Newsweek in April concluded that a war would leave one million people dead , assuming that it did not involve the use of nuclear weapons or any other outside powers . 
1	418	 In a comment in the Los Angeles Times last month , retired Air Force Brigadier General Rob Givens calculated that 20,000 South Koreans would die every day in a war on the peninsula , even without the use of nuclear weapons . 
1	418	 If the war were to develop into a nuclear exchange -- as the Trump administration has threatened -- the consequences would be catastrophic . 
1	418	 In addition to the millions or tens of millions killed outright , climate experts warned in August that even a regional nuclear war would cool the planet by up to 10 degrees Celsius , potentially sparking a global nuclear winter that would wipe out agricultural production . 
1	418	 How To Easily Kill All Indoor Odor , Mold , And Bacteria — Without Lifting A Finger 
1	418	 Despite all the evidence that war could break out at any time , the American media persists in its refusal to take the events seriously . 
1	418	" The New York Times epitomized this media effort at chloroforming the population in its October 6 article on Trump 's remarks before the generals , which stated that Trump has a "" penchant for provocative statements "" and takes "" an obvious delight in keeping people guessing . "" "
1	418	" Writing as if what was involved was merely a matter of White House gossip and intrigue , the Times stated that the "" timing "" of the "" calm before the storm "" statement was "" particularly tantalizing . "" "
1	418	" "" But it is equally plausible , "" the article concluded , "" that Mr. Trump was merely being theatrical , using the backdrop of military officers to stir up some drama . "" "
1	418	 The efforts of the media to downplay the danger are contradicted by signs of serious divisions within the Trump administration . 
1	418	 There are rumors that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will be forced out or could resign , following statements from Trump last month directly undermining Tillerson 's moves to resume negotiations with the North Korean government . 
1	418	 Thursday 's meeting of top advisers in the White House , decked out in their uniforms , may have been an effort by Trump to ensure that he has the military on his side in advance of war . 
1	418	 These divisions , however , are tactical in character . 
1	418	 In the final analysis , Trump speaks not simply for himself , but for the US ruling class . 
1	418	 The dominant factions of the ruling oligarchy are united on the basic strategy of using its military force to maintain its hegemonic position abroad . 
1	418	 Trump uses exceptionally crude and brutal language to justify American foreign policy . 
1	418	 But he is not the author of Washington 's hegemonic strategy . 
1	418	 The United States has been at war almost continuously for more than 25 years . 
1	418	 This weekend marked the sixteenth anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan . 
1	418	 The Pentagon is conducting military actions all over the world , usually without the American people being informed of the deployment of military personnel . 
1	418	 The death in combat this past week of four American soldiers in the African country of Niger came as a total surprise to the public . 
1	418	 A war with Korea could break out at any time . 
1	418	 This is the reality of the situation . 
1	418	 Rather than speculating idly over whether Trump is merely bluffing , the critical task is the building of a powerful movement , based on the working class , against the drive to war . 
1	418	 The very fact that the American president smirks and laughs as he threatens millions with annihilation is itself sufficient proof that the US political system is terminally sick and capable of any crime .

1	419	The editor - in - chief of the ultra - conservative , Steve Bannon - run news outlet Breitbart admitted during a radio broadcast Friday morning that his team 's defense of defeated Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore was a bid to protect President Donald Trump from the potential fallout from the various accusations of sexual misconduct against him . 
1	419	" During Friday morning 's broadcast of the SiriusXM Patriot station 's "" Breitbart News Daily "" program , host and editor - in - chief Alex Marlow stated in no uncertain terms that Moore was a "" horrible , "" "" terrible "" candidate , though the media property 's allegiance to Trump left him with "" no option "" but to defend his positions and his alleged behavior . "
1	419	 Multiple women have alleged that both the president and Moore either harassed or assaulted them in their years before taking elected office . 
1	419	" "" There was no option to throw Judge [ Roy ] Moore under the bus , "" said Marlow . "" "
1	419	 If you set the standard that Roy Moore , who was accused of abusing five women . . . 
1	419	" If you make that the standard , the left is going to use it to take out President Trump . "" "
1	419	 Marlow continued to cast doubt on the credibility of Moore 's accusers , but reinforced the notion that , at the end of the day , his publication 's support of the Alabama candidate was not about the contender himself . 
1	419	" "" There was never any reason to cave unless you have a . . . "
1	419	" unless you would like President Trump to get removed from office , "" he continued . "" "
1	419	" And if not even removed from office , at least have massive distractions from his agenda so that we never accomplish anything for the remainder of the president 's term . "" "
1	419	" Marlow added that "" much of the Republican Party "" would like to see the president 's leadership derailed on those terms . "" "
1	419	" Much of the Republican Party does not see that as a negative , "" he said . "
1	419	" He continued his critique of Moore . "" "
1	419	 When you 've got a race when you 've got a horrible candidate . 
1	419	" Let 's not — you guys are being too polite about Roy Moore — he was a terrible candidate , "" he said . "" "
1	419	 His message did not resonate , he had all the baggage , he had the scandal . 
1	419	 When he 'd run for statewide office he 'd only won in very tight races or relatively tight , considering he 's the Republican . 
1	419	" Roy Moore was not a good candidate at all . "" "
1	419	 Throughout the contentious 2017 Alabama special election to replace Jeff Sessions , whom Trump nominated for Attorney General shortly after he won the presidency , Breitbart was one of Moore 's more active , vociferous defenders . 
1	419	 Working hard to deny the many claims of sexual misconduct against him , forward the candidate 's bizarre , often unconstitutional positions and cast aspersions on his opponents — first GOP primary candidate Luther Strange and then Democratic contender and eventual victor Doug Jones — Breitbart became a sort of mouthpiece for the Moore campaign , even when the campaign could barely speak on its own behalf . 
1	419	 Indeed , Breitbart leader and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon directly campaigned for Moore , framing the candidate as a Trumpian , anti - establishment vanguard of a new ultra - conservative takeover of Congress ( even though the president backed Strange in the primaries ) . 
1	419	 It seems now that even Bannon 's underlings knew Moore was a poor choice for Bannon 's planned conservative insurrection , an effort that now appears dead in the water . 
1	419	 As if it needs to be said , the cynicism of a news outlet backing a candidate it knows to be a poor politician — and perhaps an even worse person — for the benefit of another potentially equally compromised figure is titanic . 
1	419	 But then again , there has never been anything idealistic or pure about Breitbart 's support of the president or , indeed , the president 's support of the hard - right racial , political and cultural agenda that publication and its followers espouse . 
1	419	" They are all "" useful idiots "" for each other . "
1	419	" With that as the power exchange active in both conservative politics and conservative media , it only stands to reason that a "" terrible , "" "" horrible "" candidate such as Moore would go so far and create so much noise standing on their shoulders . "

0	422	The 1st Amendment is the most well known to Americans of all the amendments in the Bill of Rights . 
0	422	 It contains some of the most familiar phrases in political discussion , such as freedom of religion , freedom of speech and freedom of the press . 
0	422	 The 1st Amendment reads like this : 
0	422	" "" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . "" "
0	422	 The 1st Amendment protects your right to believe and practice whatever religious principles you choose and your right to say what you believe , even if it is unpopular or against the will of elected officials . 
0	422	 It also protects your right to publish any information you want , join together with whomever you want and ask the government to correct its own errors . 
0	422	 What exactly does the 1st Amendment mean and how does it apply to people today ? 
0	422	 Does it have relevance to you today ? 
0	422	 It sure does . 
0	422	 In fact , it affects just about everything you do . 
0	422	 The 1st Amendment has seven clauses . 
0	422	 This page has a brief description of each clause with links to more detailed information about the history and purpose of each section . 
0	422	 Seven Sections of the 1st Amendment Opening Phrase 
0	422	" The Opening Phrase of the 1st Amendment says "" Congress shall make no law . "" "
0	422	 This opening phrase immediately tells exactly who this amendment is aimed at ... and that entity is Congress . 
0	422	 So the 1st Amendment specifically prohibits Congress from making laws interfering with the rights mentioned in the amendment . 
0	422	 It does not however , prohibit the states from making such laws , nor does it prohibit individuals from restricting these rights to those who may be under their authority , such as a parent and child or an employer and an employee . 
0	422	" For one hundred years the 1st Amendment was understood to only apply to the federal government , but after the Civil War and the 14th Amendment was added to the Constitution , courts began to forbid the states to interfere with these rights as well due to an idea called "" due process of law .

0	422	 This is a very crucial part of the American Constitution . 
0	422	 It prohibits the government from establishing a state religion or denomination and from directing people in what they must believe . 
0	422	 Without the Establishment Clause , the government could choose a state religion and force everyone to participate in it . 
0	422	 It could also punish anyone who did n't adhere to its chosen faith . 
0	422	 Prayer at a football game 
0	422	 This clause has been the focus of much debate in the last half century . 
0	422	 Some Americans believe that whenever the government is involved , absolutely all religious expression must be forbidden in order to comply with the Establishment Clause . 
0	422	 For example , they might say a public school football team should not pray at a football game because the school is a government funded school . 
0	422	 Other Americans believe the government must make certain allowances for religious expressions in public events and buildings because Americans are a very religious people . 
0	422	 They belive a high school football team prayer or a government employee displaying a cross at work does not violate the Establishment Clause because it is simply a personal expression and not an expression endorsed by the state . 
0	422	 Indeed , in the minds of some , banning expressions of religious faith like this is a violation of another clause of the 1st Amendment - the Free Exercise Clause , because it seeks to control the religious expressions of citizens .

0	422	 Free Exercise Clause 
0	422	" The Free Exercise Clause is the part of the 1st Amendment that says Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or "" the free exercise thereof . "" "
0	422	 This phrase deals with the restriction on Congress to regulate anyone 's religious practices . 
0	422	 US Supreme Court 
0	422	 In general , Congress can not tell people how they can or can not express their religious beliefs . 
0	422	 Such things as telling people when or how to pray , when they should go to church or to whom they should pray , are off limits to lawmakers . 
0	422	 In general , this is the case , but sometimes , minority religious groups may want to practice something that is not generally accepted or that the state has a very strong interest in regulating . 
0	422	 For example , polygamy , ritual sacrifice and drug usage have been banned at times , because there is a compelling public interest in eliminating these behaviors . 
0	422	 In such cases , the Supreme Court has often ruled that the Free Exercise Clause does not apply . 
0	422	 In other words , the Free Exercise Clause does not give free license to any behavior that someone says is their religious belief .

0	422	 The Freedom of Speech Clause 
0	422	" The Freedom of Speech Clause is the part of the 1st Amendment that says , "" Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech . "" "
0	422	 British history contained a long string of suppression by those in authority of those with whom they disagreed . 
0	422	 Many British subjects had been thrown in prison for voicing their religious and political beliefs . 
0	422	 The Americans intended to prevent this from ever happening in their newly formed republic . 
0	422	 Picket line 
0	422	 This is one of the protections in the Constitution that Americans hold most dear . 
0	422	 They value it because it allows them to speak out against government policies they do n't like . 
0	422	 It also allows them to express the religious beliefs of their choosing . 
0	422	 Negatively speaking , many people abuse this right by slandering people they disagree with , or using ugly and offensive language , racial epithets or hateful language about people who are different than they are . 
0	422	 Generally , freedom of speech is considered to be not only the words people speak , but any type of expression that is used to convey an idea . 
0	422	 Such things as picketing , wearing symbols or burning the flag are considered protected forms of speech because they are expressing the ideas of the people participating in them .

0	422	 Freedom of the Press Clause 
0	422	" The Freedom of the Press Clause states that "" Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom ... of the press . "" "
0	422	 Freedom of the Press Clause 
0	422	 This was a very important principle to the Founding Fathers of America because of the importance the press played during the Revolutionary War . 
0	422	 Without the press , the Founding Fathers would have found it very difficult to distribute their views to people in other parts of the country . 
0	422	 The press turned out to be a very important instigation in getting Americans to consolidate their views against England and in spreading the concepts that would justify a break with England . 
0	422	 English history contained no freedoms for the press whatsoever . 
0	422	 All publications were subject to governmental review before publication . 
0	422	 Criticisms of the government were strictly prosecuted as sedition . 
0	422	 All Americans wanted the right to criticize their government freely as well as to discuss other topics whenever they chose .

0	422	" The Freedom of Assembly Clause is the part of the First Amendment that reads like this : "" Congress shall make no law ... abridging ... the right of the people peaceably to assemble ... "" This clause is also sometimes referred to as the Freedom of Association Clause . "
0	422	 This clause protects the right to assemble in peace to all Americans . 
0	422	 The Freedom of Assembly was very important to early Americans because without the right to assemble , they could not coordinate their opposition to the British government . 
0	422	 The Freedom of Assembly was recognized to be of utmost importance if the Americans were to be successful in establishing a government of the people . 
0	422	 The Freedom of Assembly Clause has been relied upon by many groups in American history , such as civil rights groups , women 's suffrage groups and labor unions . 
0	422	 Government officials in each case tried to restrict the speech of these groups and prevent them from meeting , organizing and getting their message out . 
0	422	 The Freedom of Assembly proved to be an important factor that allowed these groups to prosper and see their visions fulfilled .

0	422	 The Freedom of Petition Clause of the 1st Amendment reads like this : 
0	422	" "" Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom ... of the people ... to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . "" "
0	422	 The freedom to petition the government was very important to early Americans because of their experience with trying to get King George III and Parliament to respond to their grievances . 
0	422	 The colonists were so angry about the Monarchy 's refusal to acknowledge their grievances that they mentioned this fact in the Declaration of Independence . 
0	422	 The freedom to petition the government for redress of grievances has come to include the right to do such things as picketing , protesting , conducting peaceful sitins or boycotts and addressing government officials through any media available .

0	423	Flooded homes are shown near Lake Houston following Hurricane Harvey on Aug. 30 in Texas ( Win McNamee / Getty Images ) . 
0	423	 ( GMG ) - The question is going to be asked many times , by many people : Did global warming cause or have any impact on Hurricane Irma ? 
0	423	 What about Harvey ? 
0	423	 While there is tremendous agreement among scientists about the basic science of climate change , politics and social media have created an atmosphere where a lot of incorrect information is being bantered about . 
0	423	 Here 's the truth about the relationship between global warming and hurricanes Irma and Harvey . 
0	423	 Scientists are uncertain about whether global warming will cause more hurricanes . 
0	423	 In fact , some scientists say that a warmer planet will actually result in fewer hurricanes . 
0	423	 However , that is not the entire story . 
0	423	 A warming world means that ocean temperatures increase , too . 
0	423	 And we all know that warm ocean water is the fuel that power hurricanes . 
0	423	 So , even if the coming decades show a decrease in overall hurricanes , those hurricanes that do develop in otherwise favorable conditions will likely be stronger . 
0	423	 The bottom line is that our future may be one of fewer but stronger hurricanes . 
0	423	 Is that good or bad news ? 
0	423	 Fewer hurricanes mean a lower chance that one hits Florida . 
0	423	 But a hurricane that does form and heads our way will likely be stronger , with a more severe storm surge and higher winds . 
0	423	 Something else to consider is that , as the world warms , more ocean water evaporates into the atmosphere ( which has been documented ... it 's happening ) . 
0	423	 This water vapor is what hurricanes turn into rainfall . 
0	423	 Our warmer world with higher atmospheric humidity means that tropical weather systems have more moisture to tap into , which means greater potential for increased rainfall . 
0	423	 Statistics show that extreme precipitation events nationwide are increasing , and this also applies to tropical systems . 
0	423	 What most people do n't realize is that , as summer wanes and we transition into fall , hurricanes are the atmosphere 's natural mechanism to return the summertime water vapor back into the ocean . 
0	423	 So , hurricanes are necessary to balance the planet 's water budget . 
0	423	 The only problem is that people get in the way , and hurricanes of the future likely will have higher rainfall and increased potential for catastrophic flooding events -- also due to higher storm surges , resulting from higher sea levels from the warming climate . 
0	423	 Now , let 's apply all of this information to hurricanes Irma and Harvey : 
0	423	 --------- 
0	423	 Did global warming cause Irma or Harvey ? 
0	423	 No . 
0	423	 Both hurricanes could have developed , regardless of the warming climate . 
0	423	 Could global warming have affected Irma 's record strength , or Harvey 's rapid intensification , just before landfall ? 
0	423	 Harvey strengthened rapidly from a Category 1 to a Category 4 storm in just over a day , undoubtedly due to very warm Gulf of Mexico waters it traveled over in otherwise favorable conditions . 
0	423	 It was the first Category 4 storm to make landfall in Texas since Hurricane Carla in 1961 . 
0	423	 Irma became the strongest Atlantic basin hurricane when its winds increased to 185 mph , also due to very warm ocean temperatures and otherwise favorable conditions . 
0	423	 There is no question that the warmer ocean temperatures we 're experiencing now have been impacted by the warming climate . 
0	423	 So , global warming may have been part of the reason that Harvey rapidly intensified just before landfall , and Irma became a record - breaking hurricane . 
0	423	 Did global warming cause the incredible rain amounts that Harvey produced ? 
0	423	 As we discussed above , increased atmospheric humidity due to global warming is making storms such as Harvey more predisposed to heavier rainfall . 
0	423	 However , this is not the only reason Texas saw such extraordinary rain totals . 
0	423	 Remember that most hurricanes ( such as Irma ) come and go : they make landfall and keep on moving . 
0	423	 Hurricane Harvey became a tourist . 
0	423	 It hung around for a while and meandered due to weak steering currents . 
0	423	 While most people focus on wind , the true destructive power of that storm was water . 
0	423	 Bands of torrential rain plagued southeast Texas for more than five straight days . 
0	423	 Think about that for a moment : Hurricane and tropical storm - induced heavy rain bands , day after day . 
0	423	 The bottom line is that , while global warming may have provided Harvey with extra water vapor to generate increased rainfall , the bigger reason for the catastrophic rain amounts was the storm 's unusually slow movement . 
0	423	 And by the way , there is no way to know , based upon our current knowledge , whether global warming had any impact on Harvey 's slow movement . 
0	423	 Hopefully , future research will answer that question .

1	425	A protest sign is tacked to a pole before a speaking engagement by Ben Shapiro on the campus of the University of California Berkeley in Berkeley , Calif. , Thursday , Sept. 14 , 2017 . ( 
1	425	 AP Photo / Josh Edelson ) 
1	425	 In an article focusing on free speech on the campus , The New York Times tells its readers that the UC Berkeley faculty is divided over whether or not the university should allow right - wing speakers to appear on campus . 
1	425	" Their most recent concern was motivated by a "" Free Speech Week "" event that was being put together by provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos , who was invited by a small campus group called Berkeley Patriot . "
1	425	 He was going to appear on the campus in February , but his scheduled speech was canceled after protesters prevented it from taking place . 
1	425	 The upcoming event was scheduled to take place from September 24 - 27 , but as Rick Moran reports in these pages , it was announced today that Berkeley Patriot canceled the event . 
1	425	 Participants initially mentioned were Steve Bannon and Ann Coulter , but now it has become apparent that neither planned to attend . 
1	425	" Listed speaker Charles Murray announced he would not participate in any event Milo had arranged "" because he is a despicable asshole . "" "
1	425	 Murray 's name , moreover , was listed without his knowledge or consent . 
1	425	 All of these announced speakers regularly enrage leftist students and send them into conniptions . 
1	425	 To confound issues even more , Milo Yiannopoulos announced he would appear and speak anyway at the famous Sproul Plaza , the site of the 1964 Free Speech Movement protest . 
1	425	 Promising surprises , he now is asserting his right to free speech as a private citizen to speak on campus without any formal group sponsorship or invitation . 
1	425	 Saying he would appear this Sunday at noon , there is certain to be a large police presence as well as a vast group of leftist protestors , most likely including Antifa groups . 
1	425	" The highlight at the now suspended conference was to be the "" Mario Savio Award , "" given to the individual who in their eyes has most represented the idea of free speech . "
1	425	 The name of the award is also meant to anger liberals . 
1	425	 Mario Savio led the famous Berkeley protests in the 1960s . 
1	425	 When the university moved in October of 1964 to prevent a protestor from speaking , students spontaneously surrounded the police car he had been put in . 
1	425	 Savio gave an eloquent speech that made him famous from on top of the police car . 
1	425	 Soon 3000 or more students arrived . 
1	425	 Then they took over Sproul Plaza , the administration building . 
1	425	 Eventually , scores of police arrived and arrested those students who had taken over the building . 
1	425	 Now Yiannopoulos is co - opting the once liberal and leftist cause of free speech as his own , and in effect positing that he and his associates are the ones acting in Savio 's spirit . 
1	425	" An organizer of the original ' 60s protests , playwright and author Barbara Garson , called Free Speech Week a "" grotesque parody "" of the movement she helped lead . "
1	425	 As of today — the 23rd — the event will not take place . 
1	425	 Yet Milo 's appearance — should he show up — has forced the university authorities to spend one million dollars arranging for security , since they fear the kind of violence that erupted in Charlottesville when Antifa appeared to contest the neo - Nazis and racists who planned a rally there . 
1	425	 It 's getting very expensive for conservatives to speak . 
1	425	 Recently , Ben Shapiro spoke without incident and reported he had a fruitful exchange of opinion with liberal and leftist students , although security for his talk cost UC Berkeley $ 600,000 .The Spirit of Free Speech at UC Berkeley : Why the Left Opposes It

1	429	Donald Trump has , finally , all but united the Republican Party - in denunciation of his continued , race - based attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel , who is presiding over the civil lawsuits against the candidate 's Trump University . 
1	429	" "" I disavow these comments . "
1	429	" I regret those comments that [ Trump ] made , "" said House Speaker Paul Ryan during a press conference Tuesday . "" "
1	429	" Claiming a person ca n't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment … it 's absolutely unacceptable . "" "
1	429	" And Sen. Mark Kirk , a Republican from Illinois facing a tough reelection battle this year , flat out withdrew his support for his party 's nominee , saying "" Donald Trump 's belief that an American - born judge of Mexican descent is incapable of fairly presiding over his case is not only dead wrong , it is un - American . "" "
1	429	" Last week , Trump charged that his plan to build a wall between the U.S .- Mexican border was "" an absolute conflict "" of interest , charging to the Wall Street Journal that Curiel could not preside fairly over the Trump University case because he is "" of Mexican heritage . "" ( "
1	429	 Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants . ) 
1	429	" Speaking again to CNN 's Jake Tapper last Friday , Trump maintained his position : "" He 's a Mexican . "
1	429	" We 're building a wall between here and Mexico . "" "
1	429	" When Tapper asked if , by saying that Curiel could not due his job because of his race , "" is that not the definition of racism ? "" "
1	429	" Trump responded , "" No , I do n't think so at all . "" "
1	429	" Amid the fierce backlash from his own party , Trump put together a damage - control statement late Tuesday promising not to say anything more about Curiel or the lawsuit - after this : "" It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage . "
1	429	 I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent . … 
1	429	 While this lawsuit should have been dismissed , it is now scheduled for trial in November . 
1	429	" I do not intend to comment on this matter any further . "" "
1	429	 Just one day earlier , Trump encouraged supporters on a private conference call on Monday to join his chorus by publicly questioning the judge 's credibility , two participants on the call told Bloomberg Politics . 
1	429	" Several Republican politicians , including former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown , were involved in the call , during which Trump overturned a Sunday email from his staff that ordered his most prominent supporters - those surrogates who speak for him on cable news talk shows and at campaign appearances - to cease all talk of the lawsuit and Curiel . "" "
1	429	" Take that order and throw it the hell out , "" Trump said on the call , according to Bloomberg Politics . "
1	429	 Is Hillary Clinton Intimidated by Donald Trump ? 
1	429	" Numerous other prominent Republicans have joined Ryan in disavowing Trump 's sentiments , including South Carolina 's junior senator Tim Scott - the Senate 's only black Republican - who told CNN the commentary is "" racially toxic . "" "
1	429	" Added Arnold Schwarzenegger on Twitter , "" Judge Curiel is an American hero who stood up to the Mexican cartels . "
1	429	" I was proud to appoint him when I was Gov. "" "
1	429	" Freshly - minted presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton also issued a warning on Monday that Trump may next focus his attacks on "" women judges … or maybe a judge with a disability , or perhaps one who was a former POW , or African - American . "" "
1	429	" "" He 's trying to demean and defame a federal judge who was a very accomplished federal prosecutor , "" she continued on MSNBC . "
1	429	" "" This is dangerous nonsense that undermines the rule of law , that makes him appear to be someone who has no respect for fellow Americans , "" Clinton said . "" "

0	430	 By California law and by an agreement by the water districts , California water districts and not federal taxpayers are supposed to bear the costs of the $ 16 billion project , the audit said . 
0	430	 The proposed tunnels are part of Brown 's decadeslong push for a project that would more readily carry water from green Northern California south , mainly for use by cities and farms in central and Southern California . 
0	430	 Voters rejected an early version of the proposal in a statewide vote in the 1980s . 
0	430	 California water districts are making final decisions on whether to go ahead with the controversial project . 
0	430	 The inspector general says federal authorities did not fully disclose to Congress or others that it was covering much of the cost of the project 's planning . 
0	430	 The actions by the Bureau of Reclamation , which is part of the Interior Department , mean that federal taxpayers paid a third of the cost of the project 's planning up to 2016 , the audit said . 
0	430	 Central Valley water districts that were supposed to pay 50 percent of the tunnels ' planning costs contributed only 18 percent , the audit found . 
0	430	 California officials , meanwhile , have consistently said no taxpayer money was being spent on the project . 
0	430	" Asked if auditors wanted contractors to repay the money , Interior spokeswoman Nancy DiPaolo said , "" We certainly hope so . "" "
0	430	 That decision was up to California , she said . 
0	430	" Thomas Birmingham , general manager of the sprawling Central Valley rural water district Westlands , which received one of the largest shares from the government , said he knew of nothing about the arrangement that was "" inconsistent with either state or federal law . "" "
0	430	" "" The state was aware of it , "" Birmingham said of the federal payments . "" "
0	430	" No one indicated this was somehow a violation of the letter or spirit of the agreement "" guiding the costs of the project . "
0	430	 Birmingham said water districts would be responsible for reimbursing the federal money if the project went forward and benefited those districts . 
0	430	 Spokespeople for the Bureau of Reclamation , Brown 's office and the state Department of Water Resources either had no immediate comment Friday or did not respond to requests for comment . 
0	430	" The audit 's findings were "" appalling , "" said Doug Obegi of the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group , which has opposed the project on the grounds that it would speed up the extinction of several endangered native species . "
0	430	" "" The public is paying for what a private party is supposed to pay for , "" Obegi said . "" "
0	430	" That is taking the public 's money , and that 's not OK . "" "
0	430	 A former lobbyist for Westlands , David Bernhardt , has been a top official in the Interior Department under the George W. Bush administration and again under Trump . 
0	430	 Critics long have said Westlands has benefited from its ties to the federal agency , which the water district and Interior deny . 
0	430	" "" I wish I were surprised to learn that the Westlands Water District colluded with the Interior Department to hide millions of dollars in unauthorized payments from Congress , but this is typical of the longstanding and incestuous relationship between the largest irrigation district in the country and its federal patrons , "" said U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman , a California Democrat .Audit : $ 84 M in taxpayer funds improperly used for Delta tunnels"
